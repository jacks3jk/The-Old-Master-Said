###About the Project

A database API of the Laozi (Dao De Jing) that lets you compare English translations and search by text.

###Project Status

This is a passion project and work in progress.  Currently, this project's front-end and back-end are disconnected, but should be connected by early December.

###Future Plans

- allow users to make requests through web-page
- include a feature that lets you search found quotes and returns the likelihood it comes from the Laozi.  
- continually work to update and expand the database with more English translations
