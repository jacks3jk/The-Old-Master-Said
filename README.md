**About the Project**

A database API of the Laozi (Dao De Jing) that lets you compare English translations and search by text.

**Project Status**

This is a passion project and work in progress.  Currently, this project's front-end and back-end are disconnected, but should be connected by early December.

**Future Plans**

- allow users to make requests through web-page
- include a feature that lets you search found quotes and returns the likelihood it comes from the Laozi.  
- continually work to update and expand the database with more English translations


**Bugs**

-search query DOES NOT allow for spaces at the end of the query
-JS is attempting to read an int as a string
-search text function producing StringIndexOutOfBoundsError
