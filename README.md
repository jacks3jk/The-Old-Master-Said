A database API for the Laozi (Dao De Jing).  The app serves two main functions:

1.  Lets you compare English translations of specific chapters from different authors (current count: 9).

2.  Search through the text for specific quotations (e.g. a user may check to see if 'A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step' is in any English translation of the DDJ)

**Project Status**

In progress.  

**Future Plans**

- Host the database on a server to open alpha testing.
- Include a feature that uses an algorithm to determine the liklihood a particular English quote is found in the DDJ.  
- Continually work to update and expand the database with more English translations.


**Bugs**

-JS is attempting to read an int as a string
<br>
-search text function producing StringIndexOutOfBoundsError
