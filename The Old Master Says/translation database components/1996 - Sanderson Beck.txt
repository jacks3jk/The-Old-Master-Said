10	\n1. The Mystical Way\n\nThe Way that can be described is not the absolute Way;\nthe name that can be given is not the absolute name.\nNameless it is the source of heaven and earth;\nnamed it is the mother of all things.\n\nWhoever is desireless, sees the essence of life.\nWhoever desires, sees its manifestations.\nThese two are the same,\nbut what is produced has names.\nThey both may be called the cosmic mystery:\nfrom the cosmic to the mystical\nis the door to the essence of all life.\nup\n\n2. Relativity and Not Interfering\n\nWhen the people of the world all know beauty as beauty,\nthere arises the recognition of ugliness.\nWhen they all know the good as good,\nthere arises the recognition of bad.\n\nTherefore being and non-being produce each other;\ndifficult and easy complete each other;\nlong and short contrast each other;\nhigh and low distinguish each other;\nsound and voice harmonize with each other;\nbeginning and end follow each other.\n\nTherefore the wise manage affairs without interfering\nand teach beyond the words.\n\nAll things rise, and they do not turn away from them.\nThey give them life, but do not take possession of them.\nThey act, but do not rely on their own ability.\nThey accomplish, but claim no credit.\nBecause they claim no credit,\ntheir accomplishment remains with them.\n\nup\n\n3. Simplicity\n\nDo not exalt the worthy,\nso that people will not compete.\nDo not value rare treasure,\nso that people will not steal.\nDo not display objects of desire,\nso that people's hearts will not be disturbed.\n\nTherefore the wise lead by keeping\ntheir hearts pure, their bellies full,\ntheir ambitions weak, and their bones strong,\nso that the people may be purified\nof their thoughts and desires;\nand the cunning ones will not interfere.\nBy acting without interfering, all may live in peace.\n\nup\n\n4. The Infinite Way\n\nThe Way is infinite; its use is never exhausted.\nIt is bottomless, like the fountainhead of all things.\nIt smoothes its roughness; it unties its tangles.\nIt softens its light; it calms its turmoil.\nDeep and still, ever present.\nI do not know its source.\nIt seems to have existed before the Lord.\n\nup\n\n5. Emptiness and the Center\n\nNature is not humane.\nIt treats all things like sacrificial objects.\nThe wise are not humane.\nThey regard people like sacrificial objects.\n\nHow the universe is like a bellows!\nWhile empty, it is never exhausted.\nThe more it is worked, the more it produces.\nMuch talk brings exhaustion.\nIt is better to keep to the center.\n\nup\n\n6. The Mystical Female\n\nThe spirit of the valley never dies.\nIt is called the mystical female.\nThe door of the mystical female\nis the root of heaven and earth.\nIt seems to be continuously within us.\nUse it, and it will never fail.\n\nup\n\n7. Enduring\n\nHeaven is eternal, and the earth is very old.\nThey can be eternal and long lasting,\nbecause they do not exist for themselves,\nand for this reason can long endure.\n\nTherefore the wise put themselves last,\nbut find themselves foremost.\nThey are indifferent to themselves,\nand yet they always remain.\nIs it not because they do not live for themselves\nthat they find themselves fulfilled?\n\nup\n\n8. The Best Are Like Water\n\nThe best are like water.\nWater benefits all things and does not compete with them.\nIt flows to the lowest level.\nIn this it comes near to the Way.\n\nIn their dwellings, they love the earth.\nIn their hearts, they love what is profound.\nIn their friendship, they love humanity.\nIn their words, they love sincerity.\nIn government, they love peace.\nIn business, they love ability.\nIn their actions, they love timeliness.\nIt is because they do not compete\nthat there is no resentment.\n\nup\n\n9. Moderation\n\nStretch a bow to the very full,\nand you will wish you had stopped in time.\nTemper a sword-edge to its very sharpest,\nand the edge will not last long.\n\nWhen gold and jade fill your hall,\nyou will not be able to keep them safe.\nTo be proud with honor and wealth\nis to cause one's own downfall.\nWithdraw as soon as your work is done.\nSuch is heaven's way.\n\nup\n\n10. Mystical Power\n\nCan you embrace the One with your soul,\nand never depart from the Way?\nCan you concentrate your vital force\nto achieve the gentleness of a new-born baby?\nCan you cleanse and purify your mystic vision\nuntil it is clear?\nCan you love the people and govern the state\nwithout interfering?\nCan you play the role of the female\nin opening and closing the doors of heaven?\nCan you understand all and penetrate all\nwithout using the mind?\n\nTo give birth and to nourish,\nto give birth without taking possession,\nto act without obligation,\nto lead without dominating---\nthis is mystical power.\n\nup\n\n11. Use What Does Not Exist\n\nThirty spokes are united around the hub of a wheel,\nbut the usefulness of the wheel\ndepends on the space where nothing exists.\nClay is molded into a vessel,\nbut the usefulness of the vessel\ndepends on the space where nothing exists.\nDoors and windows are cut out of the walls of a house,\nand the usefulness of the house\ndepends on the space where nothing exists.\n\nTherefore take advantage of what exists,\nand use what does not exist.\n\nup\n\n12. Satisfy the Inner Self\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes;\nthe five musical tones deafen the ears;\nthe five flavors dull the taste.\nRacing and hunting madden the mind.\nPrecious goods keep their owners on guard.\n\nTherefore the wise satisfy the inner self\nrather than external senses.\nThey accept the one and reject the other.\n\nup\n\n13. Selflessness\n\nGood fortune and misfortune cause apprehension.\nRegard great trouble as you regard your self.\n\nWhat is meant by\n"Good fortune and misfortune cause apprehension?"\nThose with good fortune are apprehensive of their gain.\nThose with misfortune are apprehensive of their loss.\n\nWhat is meant by\n"Regard great trouble as you regard your self?"\nGreat trouble comes from being selfish.\nBeing selfless, what trouble is there?\n\nTherefore those who value the world as themselves\nmay be entrusted to govern the world.\nThose who love the world as themselves\nmay be entrusted to care for the world.\n\nup\n\n14. The Formless Way\n\nWe look at it, and do not see it; it is invisible.\nWe listen to it, and do not hear it; it is inaudible.\nWe touch it, and do not feel it; it is intangible.\nThese three elude our inquiries, and hence merge into one.\n\nNot by its rising, is it bright,\nnor by its sinking, is it dark.\nInfinite and eternal, it cannot be defined.\nIt returns to nothingness.\nThis is the form of the formless, being in non-being.\nIt is nebulous and elusive.\n\nMeet it, and you do not see its beginning.\nFollow it, and you do not see its end.\nStay with the ancient Way\nin order to master what is present.\nKnowing the primeval beginning is the essence of the Way.\n\nup\n\n15. The Wise\n\nThe wise have ancient mystic wisdom\nand profound understanding, too deep to comprehend.\nBecause they can not be comprehended,\nthey can only be described by analogy:\ncautious, like crossing a stream in winter;\nalert, like one aware of danger on all sides;\ncourteous, like a visiting guest;\nself-effacing, like ice beginning to melt;\ngenuine, like a piece of uncarved wood;\nopen and receptive, like a valley;\nfreely mixing, like muddy water.\n\nWho can make sense of a muddy world?\nLet it be still, and it becomes clear.\nWho can remain calm,\nand through activity come back to life?\nThose who embrace this Way do not over-extend themselves.\nBecause they do not over-extend themselves,\nthey do not wear out and are not replaced.\n\nup\n\n16. Know the Eternal\n\nEmpty yourself of everything.\nMaintain a steady serenity.\nAll things take shape and become active,\nbut I see them return to their source,\nlike vegetation that grows and flourishes,\nbut returns to the root from which it springs.\n\nReturning to the source is serenity;\nit is to realize one's destiny.\nTo realize one's destiny is to know the eternal.\nTo know the eternal is to be enlightened.\nNot to know the eternal\nis to act blindly and court disaster.\n\nWhoever knows the eternal is open to everything.\nWhoever is open to everything is impartial.\nTo be impartial is to be universal.\nTo be universal is to be in accord with heaven.\nTo be in accord with heaven is to be in accord with the Way.\nTo be in accord with the Way is to be eternal\nand to live free from harm even though the body dies.\n\nup\n\n17. Leaders\n\nThe best leaders the people barely know.\nThe next best they love and praise.\nThe next they fear.\nAnd the next they hate.\n\nThose who lack trust will not be trusted.\nThen they resort to promises.\nBut when they accomplish their task and complete their work,\nthe people say, "We did it ourselves."\n\nup\n\n18. When the Way is Forgotten\n\nWhen the great Way is forgotten,\nthe doctrines of humanity and morality arise.\nWhen knowledge and cleverness appear,\nthere emerges great hypocrisy.\nWhen family relationships are not in harmony,\nfilial piety and parental love are advocated.\nWhen a country falls into chaos and disorder,\nthere is praise of loyal patriots.\n\nup\n\n19. What People Need\n\nAbandon religion and discard cleverness,\nand people will benefit a hundredfold.\nAbandon humanity and discard morality,\nand people will rediscover love and duty.\nAbandon skill and discard profit,\nand there will be no thieves or robbers.\nThese three things relate to externals and are inadequate.\n\nPeople need what they can depend on:\nreveal simplicity; embrace the natural;\ncontrol selfishness; reduce desires.\n\nup\n\n20. Drawing Sustenance\n\nAbandon memorizing, and vexations end.\nHow much difference is there between yes and no?\nHow much difference is there between good and evil?\nIs what people fear really to be feared?\nHow very remote the actual occurrence!\n\nThe people of the world make merry\nas though at a holiday feast or a spring carnival.\nI alone am inactive and desireless,\nlike a new-born baby who cannot yet smile,\nunattached, as though homeless.\n\nThe people of the world possess more than enough.\nI alone seem to have lost all.\nI must be a fool, so indiscriminate and nebulous.\n\nMost people seem knowledgeable and bright.\nI alone am simple and dull.\n\nMost people see differences and are sharp.\nI alone make no distinctions,\nseeming aimless, drifting as the sea,\nlike the wind blowing about, seemingly without destination.\n\nPeople of the world all have a purpose.\nI alone seem impractical and out of place.\nI am different from others,\nand value drawing sustenance from the Mother.\n\nup\n\n21. Within the Elusive Way\n\nAll-embracing power proceeds only through the Way.\nWhat is called the Way is elusive and intangible.\nIntangible and elusive, yet within it are thought-images.\nElusive and intangible, yet within it are objects.\nDeep and obscure, yet within it is the life-force.\nThe life-force is very real, and within it is certainty.\n\nFrom the ancient times till now\nits manifestations have never ceased,\nby which we may see the beginning of all things.\nHow do I know that the beginnings of all things are so?\nThrough this certainty.\n\nup\n\n22. Yielding for Unity\n\nTo yield is to preserve unity.\nTo bend is to become straight.\nTo empty oneself is to become full.\nTo wear oneself out is to be renewed.\nTo have little is to be content.\nTo have abundance is to be troubled.\n\nTherefore the wise embrace the One\nand become examples for the world.\nThey do not display themselves and are therefore illumined.\nThey do not justify themselves and are distinguished.\nThey do not make claims and are therefore given credit.\nThey do not seek glory and therefore are leaders.\n\nBecause they do not compete,\nthe world cannot compete with them.\nIs not the ancient saying true,\n"To yield is to preserve unity?"\nfor true wholeness comes from turning within.\n\nup\n\n23. Nature\n\nNature says few words.\nA whirlwind does not last all morning,\nnor does a rainstorm last a whole day.\nWhat causes them? Nature.\n\nIf even Nature's utterances do not last long,\nhow much less should human beings'?\n\nThose who follow the Way are one with the Way.\nThose who follow power are one with power.\nThose who abandon it are one with abandonment.\n\nThose one with the Way are welcomed by the Way.\nThose one with power are welcomed by power.\nThose one with abandonment are welcomed by abandonment.\nThose who lack trust will not be trusted.\n\nup\n\n24. Avoid Excess\n\nThose who stand on tiptoe are not steady.\nThose who strain their strides cannot long keep up the pace.\nThose who display themselves do not illuminate.\nThose who justify themselves are not distinguished.\nThose who make claims are not given credit.\nThose who seek glory are not leaders.\nAccording to the Way these are like extra food and waste,\nwhich all creatures detest.\nTherefore followers of the Way avoid them.\n\nup\n\n25. The Supreme\n\nThere is something mysterious and whole\nwhich existed before heaven and earth,\nsilent, formless, complete, and never changing.\nLiving eternally everywhere in perfection,\nit is the mother of all things.\n\nI do not know its name; I call it the Way.\nIf forced to define it, I shall call it supreme.\nSupreme means absolute.\nAbsolute means extending everywhere.\nExtending everywhere means returning to itself.\n\nThus the Way is supreme.\nHeaven is supreme.\nEarth is supreme.\nAnd the person is supreme.\n\nThere are four supremes in the universe,\nand the person is one of them.\nThe person reflects the earth.\nThe earth reflects heaven.\nHeaven reflects the Way.\nAnd the Way reflects its own nature.\n\nup\n\n26. Self-mastery\n\nGravity is the foundation of levity.\nSerenity masters hastiness.\nTherefore the wise travel all day\nwithout leaving their baggage.\nIn the midst of honor and glory\nthey remain leisurely and calm,\n\nHow can a leader of a great country\nbehave lightheartedly and frivolously?\nIn frivolity, the foundation is lost.\nIn hasty action, self-mastery is lost.\n\nup\n\n27. Using the Light\n\nA good traveler leaves no trace.\nA good speaker makes no slips.\nA good accountant uses no devices.\nA good door needs no bolts to remain shut.\nA good fastener needs no rope to hold its bond.\n\nTherefore the wise are good at helping people,\nand consequently no one is rejected.\nThey are good at saving things,\nand consequently nothing is wasted.\nThis is called using the Light.\n\nTherefore the good teach the bad,\nand the bad are lessons for the good.\nThose who neither value the teacher nor care for the lesson\nare greatly deluded, though they may be learned.\nSuch is the essential mystery.\n\nup\n\n28. The Valley of the World\n\nKnow the male and keep to the female.\nBecome the valley of the world.\nBeing the valley of the world is eternal power\nand returning to the innocence of a baby.\n\nKnow the bright and keep to the obscure.\nBecome an example for the world.\nBeing an example for the world is eternal power\nand returning to the infinite.\n\nKnow glory and keep to humility.\nBecome the valley of the world.\nBeing the valley of the world is eternal power\nand returning to the natural.\nBreaking up the natural makes instruments.\nThe wise use them and become leaders.\nTherefore a leader does not break.\n\nup\n\n29. Do Not Tamper with the World\n\nThose who take over the world and act upon it,\nI notice, do not succeed.\nThe world is a sacred vessel, not to be tampered with.\nThose who tamper with it, spoil it.\nThose who seize it, lose it.\n\nSome lead, and some follow.\nSome blow hot, and some blow cold.\nSome are strong, and some are weak.\nSome are up, and some are down.\nTherefore the wise avoid excess, extravagance, and pride.\n\nup\n\n30. Force of Arms\n\nWhoever advises a leader according to the Way\nopposes conquest by force of arms.\nThe use of force tends to rebound.\nWhere armies march, thorns and brambles grow.\nWhenever a great army is formed, scarcity and famine follow.\n\nThe skillful achieve their purposes and stop.\nThey dare not rely on force.\nThey achieve their purposes, but do not glory in them.\nThey achieve their purposes, but do not celebrate them.\nThey achieve their purposes, but do not take pride in them.\nThey achieve their purposes, but without violence.\n\nThings reach their prime and then decline.\nViolence is contrary to the Way.\nWhatever is contrary to the Way will soon perish.\n\nup\n\n31. War and Peace\n\nWeapons are tools of destruction hated by people.\nTherefore followers of the Way never use them.\nIn peace leaders favor the creative left.\nIn war they favor the destructive right.\n\nWeapons are tools of destruction,\nnot used by good leaders.\nWhen their use cannot be avoided,\nthe best policy is calm restraint.\n\nEven in victory there is no glory.\nThose who celebrate victory delight in slaughter.\nThose who delight in slaughter\nwill not be successful leaders.\nThe killing of many should be mourned with sorrow.\nA victory should be celebrated with funeral ceremonies.\n\nup\n\n32. The Natural Way\n\nThe Way is absolute and undefined.\nLike natural uncarved wood in simplicity,\nyet none in the world can overcome it.\nIf leaders would hold to it,\nthe whole world would serve them spontaneously.\n\nHeaven and earth join, and gentle rain falls,\nbeyond the command of anyone, evenly upon all.\nWhen civilization arose, names began.\nWith names, one should know when to stop.\nKnowing when to stop, frees one from danger.\nThe Way in the world is like\nrivers and streams flowing into the sea.\n\nup\n\n33. Inner Power\n\nThose who know others are wise.\nThose who know themselves are enlightened.\nThose who overcome others require force.\nThose who overcome themselves need strength.\nThose who are content are wealthy.\nThose who persevere have will power.\nThose who do not lose their center endure.\nThose who die but maintain their power live eternally.\n\nup\n\n34. The Great Way\n\nThe great Way flows everywhere, both left and right.\nAll things derive their life from it,\nand it does not turn away from them.\nIt accomplishes its work, but does not take possession.\nIt provides for and nourishes everything,\nbut does not control them.\n\nAlways without desires, it may be considered small.\nThe destination of all things, yet claiming nothing,\nit may be considered great.\nBecause it never claims greatness,\nits greatness is achieved.\n\nup\n\n35. The Inexhaustible Way\n\nHold to the great form, and all the world follows,\nfollowing without meeting harm,\nin health, peace, and happiness.\nMusic and delicacies to eat induce travelers to stay.\nBut the Way is mild to the taste.\nLooked at, it is invisible.\nListened to, it is inaudible.\nApplied, it is inexhaustible.\n\nup\n\n36. The Mystic Light\n\nIn order to contract, it is necessary first to expand.\nIn order to weaken, it is necessary first to strengthen.\nIn order to reduce, it is necessary first to build up.\nIn order to receive, it is necessary first to give.\nThis is called the mystic Light.\nThe soft and gentle overcome the hard and strong.\nAs fish stay in the deep water,\nso sharp weapons of the state should not be displayed.\n\nup\n\n37. The Way Never Interferes\n\nThe Way never interferes,\nyet through it everything is done.\nIf leaders would follow the Way,\nthe world would be reformed of its own accord.\nWhen reformed and desiring to act,\nlet them be restrained by what is simply natural.\nUndefined simplicity is free of desires.\nBeing free of desires, it is serene;\nand the world finds peace of its own accord.\n\nup\n\n38. The Superior\n\nSuperior power does not emphasize its power,\nand thus is powerful.\nInferior power never forgets its power,\nand thus is powerless.\nSuperior power never interferes nor has an ulterior motive.\nInferior power interferes and has an ulterior motive.\nSuperior humanity takes action but has no ulterior motive.\nSuperior morality takes action and has an ulterior motive.\nSuperior custom takes action, and finding no response,\nstretches out arms to force it on them.\n\nTherefore when the Way is lost, power arises.\nWhen power is lost, humanity arises.\nWhen humanity is lost, morality arises.\nWhen morality is lost, custom arises.\nNow custom is a superficial expression\nof loyalty and faithfulness, and the beginning of disorder.\n\nForeknowledge is the flowering of the Way\nand the beginning of folly.\nTherefore the mature dwell in the depth, not in the thin,\nin the fruit and not in the flowering.\nThey reject one and accept the other.\n\nup\n\n39. Oneness\n\nThe ancients attained oneness.\nHeaven attained oneness and became clear.\nEarth attained oneness and became stable.\nSpirits attained oneness and became divine.\nThe valleys attained oneness and became fertile.\nCreatures attained oneness and lived and grew.\nKings and nobles attained oneness and became leaders.\nWhat made them so is oneness.\n\nWithout clarity, heaven would crack.\nWithout stability, the earth would quake.\nWithout divinity, spirits would dissipate.\nWithout fertility, the valleys would be barren.\nWithout life and growth, creatures would die off.\nWithout leadership, kings and nobles would fall.\n\nTherefore humility is the basis for nobility,\nand the low is the basis for the high.\nThus kings and nobles call themselves\norphans, lonely, and unworthy.\nDo they not depend upon the common people for support?\nDismantle the parts of a chariot, and there is no chariot.\nRather than tinkle like jade, rumble like rocks.\n\nup\n\n40. Movement of the Way\n\nReturning is the movement of the Way.\nGentleness is the method of the Way.\nAll things in the world come from being,\nand being comes from non-being.\n\nup\n\n41. What the Way is Like\n\nWhen the wise hear the Way, they practice it diligently.\nWhen the mediocre hear of the Way, they doubt it.\nWhen the foolish hear of the Way, they laugh out loud.\nIf it were not laughed at, it would not be the Way.\n\nTherefore it is said,\n"The enlightenment of the Way seems like dullness;\nprogression in the Way seem like regression;\nthe even path of the Way seems to go up and down."\n\nGreat power appears like a valley.\nGreat purity appears tarnished.\nGreat character appears insufficient.\nSolid character appears weak.\nTrue integrity appears changeable.\nGreat space has no corners.\nGreat ability takes time to mature.\nGreat music has the subtlest sound.\nGreat form has no shape.\n\nThe Way is hidden and indescribable.\nYet the Way alone is adept\nat providing for all and bringing fulfillment.\n\nup\n\n42. All Things\n\nThe Way produced the One;\nthe One produced two;\ntwo produced three;\nand three produced all things.\n\nAll things have the receptivity of the female\nand the activity of the male.\nThrough union with the life force they blend in harmony.\n\nPeople hate being orphaned, lonely, and unworthy.\nYet kings and nobles call themselves such.\nOften gain can be a loss, and loss can be a gain.\nWhat others teach, I teach also:\n"The violent die a violent death."\nI shall make this primary in my teaching.\n\nup\n\n43. The Value of Non-action\n\nThe softest things in the world overcome the hardest.\nNon-being penetrates even where there is no space.\nThrough this I know the value of non-action.\nTeaching without words and the value of non-action\nare understood by few in the world.\n\nup\n\n44. How to Endure\n\nFame or your life, which do you love more?\nLife or material wealth, which is more valuable?\nLoss or gain, which is worse?\nTherefore those who desire most spend most.\nThose who hoard most lose most.\nThose who are contented are not disappointed.\nThose who know when to stop prevent danger.\nThus they can long endure.\n\nup\n\n45. Skill Seems Awkward\n\nThe greatest perfection seems incomplete,\nbut its utility is never impaired.\nThe greatest fullness seems empty,\nbut its use cannot be exhausted.\nWhat is most direct seems devious.\nThe greatest skill seems awkward.\nThe greatest eloquence seems like stuttering.\n\nMovement overcomes cold.\nStillness overcomes heat.\nThe serene and calm are guides for all.\n\nup\n\n46. Contentment\n\nWhen the world lives in accord with the Way,\nhorses work on farms.\nWhen the world does not live in accord with the Way,\nthe cavalry practices in the parks.\n\nThe greatest temptation to crime is desire.\nThe greatest curse is discontent.\nThe greatest calamity is greed.\nWhoever is content with contentment is always content.\n\nup\n\n47. Understanding\n\nOne can know the world without going outside.\nOne can see the Way of heaven\nwithout looking out the window.\nThe further one goes the less one knows.\nTherefore the wise know without going about,\nunderstand without seeing,\nand accomplish without acting.\n\nup\n\n48. Doing Less\n\nThe pursuit of learning is to increase day by day.\nThe practice of the Way is to decrease day by day.\nLess and less is done until one reaches non-action.\nWhen nothing is done, nothing is left undone.\nThe world is led by not interfering.\nThose who interfere cannot lead the world.\n\nup\n\n49. The Power of Goodness\n\nThe wise have no mind-set.\nThey regard the people's minds as their own.\nThey are good to people who are good.\nThey are also good to people who are not good.\nThis is the power of goodness.\nThey are honest to those who are honest.\nThey are also honest to those who are dishonest.\nThis is the power of honesty.\nThe wise live in the world peacefully and harmoniously.\nThe people share a common heart,\nand the wise treat them as their own children.\n\nup\n\n50. Those Who Preserve Life\n\nComing into life and going out at death,\nthe organs of life are thirteen;\nthe organs of death are thirteen;\nand these thirteen make life vulnerable to death.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they feed life too grossly.\n\nIt is said that those who preserve life\nwalk the earth without fearing tigers and wild buffalo,\nand in battle they are not touched by weapons of war.\nThe wild buffalo's horns find nothing to gore;\nthe tiger's claws find nothing to tear;\nand weapons' points find nothing to pierce.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they have nothing for death to enter.\n\n\n(Note: The thirteen organs of life may refer to the nine openings\nin the body and the four limbs.)\n\nup\n\n51. Mystical Power\n\nThe Way produces all things.\nPower nourishes them.\nMatter gives them physical form.\nEnvironment shapes their abilities.\nTherefore all things respect the Way and honor power.\nThe Way is respected, and power is honored\nwithout anyone's order and always naturally.\n\nTherefore the Way produces all things,\nand power nourishes them,\ncaring for them and developing them,\nsheltering them and comforting them,\nnurturing them and protecting them,\nproducing them but not possessing them,\nhelping them but not obligating them,\nguiding them but not controlling them.\nThis is mystical power.\n\nup\n\n52. Practicing the Eternal\n\nThe beginning of the universe is the mother of all things.\nThose who discover the mother understand the children.\nUnderstanding the children and returning to the mother,\nthey live always free from harm.\n\nClose the mouth, shut the doors,\nand all of life is without strain.\nOpen the mouth, meddle with affairs,\nand all of life is beyond help.\n\nSeeing the small is insight;\nto stay with the gentle is strength.\nUse the Light, return to insight,\nand thereby be preserved from harm.\nThis is practicing the eternal.\n\nup\n\n53. Leaders in Robbery\n\nThose with even a scrap of sense\nwalk on the main way and fear only straying from the path.\nThe main way is smooth and easy,\nbut people like to be side-tracked.\n\nWhile the courts are arrayed in splendor,\nthe fields are full of weeds,\nand the granaries are empty.\nYet some wear embroidered clothes, carry sharp swords,\nover-indulge themselves with food and drink,\nand have more possessions than they can use.\nThey are leaders in robbery.\nThis is not the Way.\n\nup\n\n54. Power\n\nWhat is well established cannot be uprooted.\nWhat is firmly held cannot slip away.\nThe power of sacrifice continues on\nfrom generation to generation.\n\nCultivated in the person, power becomes real.\nCultivated in the family, power becomes abundant.\nCultivated in the community, power endures.\nCultivated in the nation, power flourishes.\nCultivated in the world, power becomes universal.\n\nTherefore see the person as a person,\nthe family as a family, the community as a community,\nthe nation as a nation, and the world as universal.\nHow do I know that the world is like this?\nBy this.\n\nup\n\n55. Know Harmony\n\nThose filled with power are like new-born children.\nPoisonous insects will not sting them;\nferocious beasts will not pounce upon them;\npredatory birds will not swoop down on them.\nTheir bones are pliable, their muscles tender,\nbut their grip is firm.\nThey have never known the union of man and woman,\nbut the organ is fully formed,\nmeaning that the vital essence is strong.\nThey may cry all day without getting hoarse,\nmeaning that the harmony is perfect.\nTo know harmony is to be in accord with the eternal.\nTo know the eternal is to be enlightened.\n\nTo try to force life is ominous.\nTo force the vital essence with the mind is violence.\nThe prime is past, and decay follows,\nmeaning that it is contrary to the Way.\nWhatever is contrary to the Way will soon perish.\n\nup\n\n56. Mystical Unity\n\nThose who know do not speak.\nThose who speak do not know.\nClose the mouth; shut the doors.\nSmooth the sharpness; untie the tangles.\nDim the glare; calm the turmoil.\nThis is mystical unity.\nThose achieving it are detached from friends and enemies,\nfrom benefit and harm, from honor and disgrace.\nTherefore they are the most valuable people in the world.\n\nup\n\n57. Love Peace\n\nStates are governed by justice.\nWars are waged by violations.\nThe world is mastered by nonintervention.\nHow do I know this? By this:\nThe more restrictions there are, the poorer the people.\nThe more sharp weapons, the more trouble in the state.\nThe more clever cunning, the more contrivances.\nThe more rules and regulations, the more thieves and robbers.\n\nTherefore the wise say,\n"Do not interfere, and people transform themselves.\nLove peace, and people do what is right.\nDo not intervene, and people prosper.\nHave no desires, and people live simply."\n\nup\n\n58. Results of Process\n\nWhen the government is relaxed, people are happy.\nWhen the government is strict, people are anxious.\nGood fortune leans on bad fortune;\nbad fortune hides behind good fortune.\nWho knows the results of process?\nIs there no justice?\nWhen the just become unjust, goodness becomes evil.\nPeople have been deluded for a long time.\nTherefore the wise are square but not cornered,\nsharp but not cutting, straight but not strained,\nbrilliant but not dazzling.\n\nup\n\n59. Be Frugal\n\nIn leading people and serving heaven\nit is best to be frugal.\nBeing frugal is to be prepared from the start.\nBeing prepared from the start is to build up power.\nBy building up power nothing is impossible.\nIf nothing is impossible, then there are no limits.\nThose without limits are capable of leading a country.\nThose with maternal leadership can long endure.\nThis is to be deeply rooted in a firm foundation,\nthe way of long life and eternal vision.\n\nup\n\n60. Spirits\n\nLeading a large country is like cooking a small fish.\nWhen the world is led in accord with the Way,\nspirits lose their powers.\nIt is not that they lose their powers,\nbut that their powers no longer harm people.\nNot only do the spirits not harm people,\nbut the wise also do not harm people.\nNot harming each other, spiritual power grows.\n\nup\n\n61. Large and Small Countries\n\nA large country is like low land where rivers flow,\na place where everything comes together, the female of all.\nThe female overcomes the male with tranquillity.\nTranquillity is underneath.\nA large country wins over a small country\nby placing itself below the small country.\nA small country wins over a large country\nby placing itself below the large country.\n\nThus some win by placing themselves below,\nand others win by being below.\nA large country wants to protect people,\nand a small country wants to join and serve.\nThus both get what they want.\nIt is best for the large country to place itself below.\n\nup\n\n62. The Way is Valued\n\nThe Way is sacred to all things.\nIt is treasure for the good and sanctuary for the bad.\nFine words can buy honor.\nGood deeds can gain respect.\nThough there be bad people, why reject them?\n\nTherefore at the crowning of the emperor\nor at the installation of the three ministers,\ninstead of sending gifts of jade and a team of four horses,\nremain still and send the Way.\n\nWhy did the ancients prize this Way?\nDid they not say, "Seek, and you will find;\nlet go, and you will be forgiven."\nTherefore the Way is valued by the world.\n\nup\n\n63. The Wise Never Strive\n\nAct without interfering.\nWork without doing.\nTaste the tasteless.\nLarge or small, many or few, repay injury with goodness.\n\nHandle the difficult while it is still easy.\nHandle the big while it is still small.\nDifficult tasks begin with what is easy.\nGreat accomplishments begin with what is small.\n\nTherefore the wise never strive for the great\nand thus achieve greatness.\nRash promises inspire little trust.\nTaking things too lightly results in much difficulty.\nThus the wise always confront difficulties\nand therefore have no difficulty.\n\nup\n\n64. Do Not Grab\n\nWhat stays still is easy to hold.\nWithout omens it is easy to plan.\nThe brittle is easy to shatter.\nThe minute is easy to scatter.\nHandle things before they appear.\nOrganize things before there is confusion.\nA tree as big as a person's embrace grows from a tiny shoot.\nA tower nine stories high begins with a mound of earth.\nA journey of a thousand miles begins under one's feet.\n\nTo act is to fail.\nTo grab is to lose.\nTherefore the wise do not act and do not fail.\nThey do not grab and do not lose.\nIn handling things people usually fail\nwhen they are about to succeed.\nBe as careful at the end as at the beginning,\nand there will be no failure.\n\nTherefore the wise desire to have no desires.\nThey do not value rare treasures.\nThey learn what is unknown,\nreturning to what many have missed\nso that all things may be natural without interference.\n\nup\n\n65. Know the Eternal Standard\n\nThe ancients who ruled skillfully\ndid not try to enlighten people but kept them in the dark.\nPeople are hard to lead when they are too clever.\nThose who lead with cleverness rob the country.\nThose who lead without cleverness bless the country.\nUnderstanding these two is to know the eternal standard.\nKnowing the eternal standard is mystical power.\nMystical power is deep and far-reaching,\nleading all things to return to perfect harmony.\n\nup\n\n66. Leading from Behind\n\nGreat rivers and seas are lords of all mountain streams,\nbecause they are good at staying below them.\nTherefore they are lords of the streams.\nThus the wise in watching over the people\nspeak humbly from below the people,\nand in leading the people get behind them.\nIn this way the wise watch over the people\nbut do not oppress them;\nthey lead the people but do not block them.\nThus everyone happily goes along without getting tired.\nBecause they do not compete,\nthe world cannot compete with them.\n\nup\n\n67. Three Treasures\n\nEveryone says the Way is great and beyond comparison.\nBecause it is great, it cannot be compared.\nIf it were compared, it already would have seemed small.\n\nI have three treasures to be maintained and cherished:\nthe first is love;\nthe second is frugality;\nthe third is not pushing oneself ahead of others.\n\nFrom love comes courage;\nfrom frugality comes generosity;\nfrom not pushing oneself ahead of others comes leadership.\n\nNow courage without love, generosity without frugality,\nand leadership by pushing oneself ahead of others are fatal.\nFor love wins all battles and is the strongest defense.\nHeaven gives love to save and protect.\n\nup\n\n68. The Power of Not Striving\n\nThe best soldier is not violent.\nThe best fighter is not angry.\nThe best winner is not contentious.\nThe best employer is humble.\nThis is known as the power of not striving,\nas ability in human relations,\nand as being in accord with heaven.\n\nup\n\n69. The Kind Win\n\nThe strategists say,\n"Do not be the aggressor but the defender.\nDo not advance an inch, but retreat a foot instead."\nThis is movement without moving,\nstretching the arm without showing it,\nconfronting enemies with the idea there is no enemy,\nholding in the hand no weapons.\nNo disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy.\nUnderestimating the enemy will destroy my treasures.\nThus when the battle is joined,\nit is the kind who will win.\n\nup\n\n70. My Ideas Are Easy\n\nMy ideas are easy to understand and easy to practice.\nYet no one understands them or practices them.\nMy ideas have a source; my actions have a master.\nBecause people do not understand this, they do not know me.\nSince few know me, I am very precious.\nTherefore the wise wear coarse clothes\nand keep the jewel inside.\n\nup\n\n71. A Disease\n\nTo know that you do not know is the best.\nTo think you know when you do not is a disease.\nRecognizing this disease as a disease is to be free of it.\nThe wise are free of disease,\nbecause they recognize the disease as a disease.\nTherefore they are free of disease.\n\nup\n\n72. Do Not Suppress\n\nWhen people lack a sense of awe,\nthen something awful will happen.\nDo not constrict people's living space.\nDo not suppress their livelihoods.\nIf you do not harass them, they will not harass you.\n\nTherefore the wise know themselves\nbut do not display themselves.\nThey love themselves but do not exalt themselves.\nThey let go of one and accept the other.\n\nup\n\n73. The Way of Heaven\n\nThose brave in killing will be killed.\nThose brave in not killing will live.\nOf these two, one is good, and one is harmful.\nSome are not favored by heaven. Who knows why?\nEven the wise consider it a difficult question.\n\nThe Way of heaven does not strive; yet it wins easily.\nIt does not speak; yet it gets a good response.\nIt does not demand; yet all needs are met.\nIt is not anxious; yet it plans well.\nThe net of heaven is vast;\nits meshes are wide, but nothing slips through.\n\nup\n\n74. Death\n\nPeople are not afraid to die.\nSo why threaten them with death?\nIf people were afraid of death,\nand lawbreakers could be caught and put to death,\nwho would dare to do so?\nThere is the Lord of Death who executes.\nTrying to do his job\nis like trying to cut wood for the Master Carpenter.\nThose who try to cut wood for the Master Carpenter\nrarely escape injuring their own hands.\n\nup\n\n75. Valuing Life\n\nPeople are hungry,\nbecause rulers eat too much tax-grain.\nThat is why people are starving.\n\nPeople are hard to govern,\nbecause rulers interfere too much.\nThat is why they are hard to govern.\n\nPeople do not care about death,\nbecause rulers demand too much of life.\nThat is why they do not care about death.\nOnly those who do not interfere with living\nare best at valuing life.\n\nup\n\n76. Life Is Tender\n\nWhen people are born, they are tender and supple.\nAt death they are stiff and hard.\nAll things, like plants and trees,\nare tender and pliant while alive.\nAt death they are dried and withered.\nTherefore the stiff and hard are companions of death.\nThe tender and supple are companions of life.\nThus strong arms do not win.\nA stiff tree will break.\nThe hard and strong will fall.\nThe tender and supple will rise.\n\nup\n\n77. Taking and Giving\n\nThe Way of heaven is like bending a bow.\nThe high is lowered; the low is raised.\nThe excessive is reduced; the deficient is increased.\nThe Way of heaven takes from those who have too much\nand gives to those who do not have enough.\n\nThe human way is different.\nIt takes from those who do not have enough\nand gives to those who have too much.\n\nWho has more than enough to give to the world?\nOnly the person of the Way.\nTherefore the wise act but do not rely on their own ability.\nThey accomplish the task but claim no credit.\nThey have no desire to seem superior.\n\nup\n\n78. The Soft and Weak\n\nNothing in the world is softer and weaker than water.\nYet nothing is better at attacking the hard and strong.\nThere is no substitute for it.\nThe weak overcomes the strong; the soft overcomes the hard.\nEveryone knows this, but no one puts it into practice.\n\nTherefore the wise say,\n"Those who bear the humiliation of the people\nare able to minister to them.\nThose who take upon themselves the sins of the society\nare able to lead the world."\nWords of truth seem paradoxical.\n\nup\n\n79. Stay with the Good\n\nCompromising with great hatred surely leaves some hatred.\nHow can this be considered good?\nTherefore the wise keep their part of an agreement\nand do not blame the other party.\nThe good fulfill their obligations;\nthe bad exact obligations from others.\nThe Way of heaven is impartial.\nIt always stays with the good.\n\nup\n\n80. Home Is Comfortable\n\nIn a small country with few people\nmachines that can work ten or a hundred times faster\nare not needed.\nPeople who care about death do not travel far.\nEven if there are ships and carriages, no one takes them.\nEven if there are armor and weapons, no one displays them.\nPeople return to knotted rope for records.\nFood is tasty; clothes are beautiful;\nhome is comfortable; customs are delightful.\nThough neighboring communities see each other\nand hear each other's cocks crowing and dogs barking,\nthey may grow old and die without going there.\n\nup\n\n81. True Words\n\nTrue words are not beautiful.\nBeautiful words are not truthful.\nThe good do not argue.\nThose who argue are not good.\nThose who know are not scholarly.\nThe scholarly do not know.\n\nThe wise do not hoard.\nThe more they give to others, the more they have.\nThe Way of heaven sharpens but does no harm.\nThe Way of the wise accomplishes without striving.\n
