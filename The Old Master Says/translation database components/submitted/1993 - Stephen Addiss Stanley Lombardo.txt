7	1\nTao called Tao is not Tao. Names can name no lasting name.\nNameless: the origin of heaven and earth. Naming: the mother of ten thousand things.\nEmpty of desire, perceive mystery. Filled with desire, perceive manifestations.\nThese have the same source, but different names.\nCall them both deep - Deep and again deep: the gateway to all mystery.\n2\nRecognize beauty and ugliness is born.\nRecognize good and evil is born.\nIs and Isn't produce each other. Hard depends on easy, Long is tested by short,\nHigh is determined by low, Sound is harmonized by voice, After is followed by before.\nTherefore the sage is devoted to non action, Moves without teaching,\nCreates ten thousand things without instruction, Lives but does not own, Acts but does not presume,\nAccomplishes without taking credit. When no credit is taken, Accomplishment endures.\n3\nDon't glorify heroes, And people will not contend.\nDon't treasure rare objects, And no one will steal.\nDon't display what people desire, And their hearts will not be disturbed.\nTherefore, the Sage rules By emptying hearts and filling bellies, By weakening ambitions and strengthening bones; Leads people Away from knowing and wanting;\nDeters those who know too much From going too far:\nPractices non-action And the natural order is not disrupted.\n4\nTao is empty- its use never exhausted.\nBottomless - the origin of all things.\nIt blunts sharp edges, Unties knots, Softens glare, Becomes one with the dusty world.\nDeeply subsistent -\nI don't know whose child it is. It is older than the Ancestor.\n5\nHeaven and Earth are not kind: The ten thousand things are straw dogs to them.\nThe Sage is not kind: People are straw dogs to him.\nYet Heaven and Earth And all the space between Are like a bellows: Empty but inexhaustible, Always producing more.\nLongwinded speech is exhausting. Better to stay centered.\n6\nThe Valley Spirit never dies. It is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe entrance top the Mysterious Female Is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nEndless flow of inexhaustible energy.\n7\nHeaven is long, Earth enduring.\nLong and enduring Because they do not exist for themselves.\nTherefore the Sage Steps back, but is always in front, Stays outside, but is always within.\nNo self-interest?\nSelf is fulfilled?\n8\nBest to be like water, Which benefits the ten thousand things And does not contend. It pools where humans disdain to dwell, Close to the Tao.\nLive in a good place. Keep your mind deep. Treat others well. Stand by your word.\nMake fair rules. Do the right thing. Work when it's time.\nOnly do not contend, And you will not go wrong.\n9\nHold and fill it - No as good as stopping in time.\nMeasure and pound it - It will not long survive.\nWhen gold and jade fill the hall, They cannot be guarded.\nRiches and pride Bequeath error.\nWithdrawing when work is done: Heaven's Tao.\n10\nCan you balance your life force And embrace the One Without separation?\nCan you control your breath Gently Like a baby?\nCan you clarify Your dark vision Without blemish?\nCan you love people And govern the country Without knowledge?\nCan you open and close The gate of heaven Without clinging to earth?\nCan you brighten The four directions Without action?\nGive birth and cultivate. Give birth and do not possess. Act without dependence. Excel but do not rule. This is called the dark Te.\n11\nThirty spokes join one hub. The wheel's use comes from emptiness.\nClay is fired to make a pot. The pot's use comes from emptiness.\nWindows and doors are cut to make a room. The room's use comes from emptiness.\nTherefore, Having leads to profit, Not having leads to use.\n12\nFive colors darken the eyes. Five tones darken the ears. Five tastes jade the palate.\nHunting and racing madden the heart. Exotic goods ensnarl human lives.\nTherefore the Sage Takes care of the belly, not the eye, Chooses one, rejects the other.\n13\nFavour and disgrace are like fear. Honour and distress are like the self.\nWhat does this mean? Favour debases us. Afraid when we get it, Afraid when we lose it.\nThe self embodies distress. No self, No distress.\nRespect the world as your self: The world can be your lodging. Love the world as your self: The world can be your trust.\n14\nSeeing but not seeing, we call it dim. Listening but not hearing, we call it faint. Groping but not touching, we call it subtle.\nThese three cannot be fully grasped. Therefore they become one.\nRising, it is not bright; setting it is not dark. It moves all things back to where there is nothing\nMeeting it there is no front, following it there is no back.\nLive in the ancient Tao, Master the existing present, Understand the source of all things. This is called the record of Tao.\n15\nThe ancients who followed Tao: Dark, wondrous, profound, penetrating. Deep beyond knowing.\nBecause they cannot be known, They can only be described. Cautious, like crossing a winter stream. Hesitant, like respecting one's neighbours. Polite, like a guest.\nYielding, Like ice about to melt; Blank, like uncarved wood. Open, like a valley. Mixing freely, like muddy water.\nCalm the muddy water, It becomes clear. Move the inert, It comes to life.?\nThose who sustain Tao Do not wish to be full. Because they do not wish to be full They can fade away Without further effort.\n16\nAttain complete emptiness, Hold fast to stillness.\nThe ten thousand things stir about; I only watch for their going back. Things grow and grow, But each goes back to its root.\nGoing back to the root is stillness. This means returning to what is. Returning to what is Means going back to the ordinary.\nUnderstanding the ordinary: Enlightenment. Not understanding the ordinary: Blindness creates evil. Understanding the ordinary: Mind opens. Mind opening leads to compassion, Compassion to nobility, Nobility to heavenliness, Heavenliness to Tao.\nTao endures. Your body dies. There is no danger.\n17\nGreat rising and falling - People only know it exists. Next they see and praise. Soon they fear. Finally they despise.\nWithout fundamental trust There is no trust at all. Be careful in valuing words.\nWhen the work is done, Everyone says We just acted naturally.\n18\nGreat Tao rejected: Benevolence and righteousness appear.\nLearning and knowledge professed: Great Hypocrites spring up.\nFamily relations forgotten: Filial piety and affection arise.\nThe nation disordered: Patriots come forth.\n19\nBanish learning, discard knowledge: People will gain a hundredfold.\nBanish benevolence, discard righteousness: People will return to duty and compassion.\nBanish skill, discard profit: There will be no more thieves.\nThese three statements are not enough. One more step is necessary.\nLook at plain silk; hold uncarved wood. The self dwindles; desires fade.\n20\nBanish learning, no more grief. Between Yes and No How much difference? Between good and evil How much difference??\nWhat others fear I must fear - How pointless!\nPeople are wreathed in smiles As if at a carnival banquet. I alone am passive, giving no sign, Like an infant who has not yet smiles. Forlorn as if I had no home.\nOthers have enough and more, I alone am left out. I have the mind of a fool, Confused, confused.\nOthers are bright and intelligent, I alone and dull, dull, Drifting on the ocean, Blown about endlessly.\nOthers have plans, I alone am wayward and stubborn, I alone am different from others, Like a baby in the womb.\n21\nGreat Te appears Flowing from Tao.\nTao in action - Only vague and intangible. Intangible and vague, But within it are images. Vague and intangible; Within are entities. Shadowy and obscure; Within there is life, Life so real, That within it there is trust.\nFrom the beginning its name is not lost But reappears through multiple origins.\nHow do I know these origins? Like this.\n22\nCrippled become whole, Crooked becomes straight, Hollow becomes full, Worn becomes new, Little becomes more, Much becomes delusion.\nTherefore the Sages cling to the One And take care of this world;\nDo not display themselves And therefore shine. Do not assert themselves and therefore stand out. Do not praise themselves And therefore succeed.\nDo not contend And therefore no one under heaven Can contend with them.\nThe old saying Crippled becomes whole Is not empty words. It becomes whole and returns.\n23\nSpare words; nature's way. Violent winds do not blow all morning. Sudden rain cannot pour all day.\nWhat causes these things? Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth do not blow and pour for long, How much less should humans?\nTherefore in following Tao: Those on the way become the way, Those who gain become the gain, Those who lose become the loss.\nAll within the Tao: The wayfarer, welcome upon the way, Those who gain, welcome within gain, Those who lose, welcome withon loss.\nWithout trust in this, There is no trust at all.\n24\nUpon tiptoe: no way to stand. Clambering: no way to walk.\nSelf-display: no way to shine. Self-assertion: no way to succeed.\nSelf-praise: no way to flourish. Complacency: no way to endure.\nAccording to Tao, Excessive food, Extraneous activity Inspire disgust. Therefore the follower of Tao Moves on.\n25\nSomething unformed and complete Before heaven and Earth were born, Solitary and silent, Stands alone and unchanging. Pervading all things without limit. It is like the mother of all things under heaven,\nBut I don't know its name - Better call it Tao. Better call it great.\nGreat means passing on. Passing on means going far. Going far means returning.\nTherefore Tao is great, And heaven, And earth, And humans. Four great things in the world. Aren't humans one of them?\nHumans follow earth Earth follows heaven Heaven follows Tao. Tao follows its own nature.\n26\nGravity is the root of lightness, Stillness the master of passion.\nThe Sage travels all day But does not leave the baggage-cart; When surrounded by magnificent scenery Remains calm and still.\nWhen a lord of ten thousand chariots Behaves lightly in this world,\nLightness loses its root, Passion loses its master.\n27\nGood travelers leave no tracks. Good words leave no trace. Good counting needs no markers.\nGood doors have no bolts Yet cannot be forced. Good knots have no rope But cannot be untied.\nIn this way the Sage Always helps people And rejects none, Always helps all beings, And rejects none. This is called practicing brightness.\nTherefore the good person is the bad person's teachers, And the bad person Is the good person's resource.\nNot to value the teacher, Not to love the resource, Causes great confusion even for the intelligent. This is called the vital secret.\n28\nKnow the male, maintain the female, Become the channel of the world, And Te will endure. Return to infancy.\nKnow the white, sustain the black, Become the pattern of the world, And Te will not falter. Return to the uncarved block.\nKnow honour, sustain disgrace, Become the valley of the world, And Te will prevail. Return to simplicity.\nSimplicity divided becomes utensils That are used by the Sage as high official. But great governing does not carve up.\n29\nTrying to control the world? I see you won't succeed.\nThe world is a spiritual vessel And cannot be controlled. Those who control, fail. Those who grasp, lose.\nSome go forth, some are led, Some weep, some blow flutes, Some become strong, some superfluous, Some oppress, some are destroyed.\nTherefore the Sage Casts off extremes, Casts off excess, Casts off Extravagance.\n30\nUse Tao to help rule people. This world has no need for weapons, Which soon turn on themselves.\nWhere armies camp, nettles grow. After each war, years of famine.\nThe most fruitful outcome Does not depend on force,\nBut succeeds without arrogance Without hostility Without Pride Without resistance Without violence.\nIf these things prosper and grow old, This is called not-Tao. Not-Tao soon ends.\n31\nFine weapons are ill-omened tools. They are hated. Therefore the old Tao ignores them.\nAt home, honour the left. In war, honor the right.\nGood omens honour the left. Bad omens honour the right. The lieutenant on the left, The general on the right As in funeral ceremonies.\nWeapons are ill-omened, Not proper instruments. When their use can't be avoided, Calm restraint is best. Don't think they are beautiful. Those who think they are beautiful Rejoice in killing people.\nThose who rejoice in killing people Cannot achieve their purpose in this world.\nWhen many people are killed We feel sorrow and grief. A great victory Is a funeral ceremony.\n32\nTao endures without a name. Though simple and slight, No one under heaven can master it.\nIf kings and lords could posses it, All beings would become their guests.\nHeaven and earth together Would drip sweet dew Equally on all people Without regulation.\nBegin to make order and names arise. Names lead to more names - And to knowing when to stop.\nTao's presence in this world Is like valley streams Flowing into rivers and seas.\n33\nKnowing others is intelligent. Knowing yourself is enlightened.\nConquering others takes force. Conquering yourself is true strength.\nKnowing what is enough is wealth. Forging ahead shows inner resolve.\nHold your ground and you will last long. Die without perishing and your life will endure.\n34\nGreat Tao overflows. To the left To the right.\nAll beings owe their life to it And do not depart from it. It acts without a name. It clothes and nourishes all beings But does not become their master.\nEnduring without desires, It may be called slight.\nAll beings return to it, But it does not become their master. It may be called immense.\nBy not making itself great, It can do great things.\n35\nHold the great elephant - The great image - And the world moves. Moves without danger in safety and peace.\nMusic and sweets Make passing guests pause.\nBut the Tao emerges Flavourless and bland. Look - you won't see it. Listen - You won't hear it. Use it - You will never use it up.\n36\nTo collect, first scatter. To Weaken, first strengthen. To abolish, first establish. To conclude, first initiate.\nThis is called subtle illumination. Soft and weak overcome stiff and strong.\nFish cannot escape the deep pool. A country's sharpest weapons Cannot be displayed.\n37\nTao endures without a name, Yet nothing is left undone.\nIf kings and lords could possess it, All beings would transform themselves. Transformed, they desire to create; I quiet them through nameless simplicity. Then there is no desire.\nNo desire is serenity, An the world settles of itself.\n38\nHigh Te? No Te! That's what Te is. Low Te doesn't lack Te; That's what Te is not.\nThose highest in Te take no action And don't need to act. Tose lowest in Te take action And do need to act.\nThose highest in benevolence take action But don't need to act. Those highest in righteousness take action And do need to act. Those highest in propriety take action And if people don't reciprocate Roll up their sleeves and throw them out.\nTherefore Lose Tao And Te follows. Lose Te and benevolence follows. Lose benevolence And righteousness follows. Lose righteousness and propriety follows.\nPropriety dilutes loyalty and sincerity: Confusion begins. Foreknowledge glorifies the Tao: Stupidity sets in.\nAnd so the ideal person dwells In substance, not dilution, In reality, not glory, Accepts one, rejects the other.\n39\nOf old, these attained the One: Heaven attaining the One Became clear. Earth attaining the One Became stable. Spirits attaining the One Became sacred.\nValleys attaining the One Became bountiful. Myriad beings attaining the One Became fertile. Lords and kings attaining the One Purified the world.\nIf Heaven were not clear It might split. If Earth were not stable It might erupt. If spirits were not sacred They might fade.\nIf valleys were not bountiful They might wither. If myriad beings were not fertile, They might perish. If rulers and lords were not noble, They might stumble.\nTherefore, Noble has humble as its root, High has low as its foundation.\nRulers and lords call themselves Poor and lonely orphans. Isn't this using humility as a root?\nThey use many carriages But have no carriage;.\nThey do not desire to glisten like jade But drop like a stone.\n40\nReversal is Tao's movement. Yielding is Tao's practice.\nAll things originate from being. Being originates from non-being.\n41\nThe great scholar hearing the Tao Tries to practice it. The middling scholar hearing the Tao, Sometimes has it, sometimes not.\nThe lesser scholar hearing the Tao Has a good laugh. Without that laughter It wouldn't be Tao.\nTherefore these sayings: The bright road seems dark, The road forward sees to retreat, The level road seems rough.\nGreat Te seems hollow. Great purity seems sullied. Pervasive Te sees deficient. Established Te seems furtive. Simple truths seem to change. The great square has no corners. The great vessel is finished late. The great sound is scarcely voiced. The great image has no form.\nTao hides, no name. Yet Tao alone gets things done.\n42\nTao engenders One, One engenders Two, Two engenders Three, Three engenders the ten thousand things.\nThe ten thousand things carry shade And embrace sunlight. Shade and sunlight, yin and yang, Breath blending into harmony.\nHumans hate To be alone, poor, and hungry. Yet kings and princes Use these words as titles.\nWe gain by losing, Lose by gaining.\nWhat others teach, I also teach: "A violent man does not die a natural death. This is the basis of my teaching.\n43\nThe softest thing in the world rides roughshod over the strongest. No-thing enters no-space. This teaches me the benefits of no-action.\nTeaching without words Benefit without action - Few in this world can attain this.\n44\nName or body: which is closer? Body or possessions: which means more? Gain or loss: Which one hurts?\nExtreme love exacts a great price. Many possessions entail a heavy loss.\nKnow what is enough - Abuse nothing. Know when to stop - Harm nothing. This is how to last for a long time.\n45\nGreat accomplishment seems unfinished But its use is continuous. Great fullness seems empty But in use is inexhaustible.\nGreat straightness seems bent, Great skill seems clumsy, Great eloquence seems mute.\nExertion overcomes cold. Calm overcomes heat. Pure calm is the norm under heaven.\n46\nWith Tao under heaven Stray horses fertilize the fields. Without Tao under heaven Warhorses are bred at the frontier.\nThere is no greater calamity Than not knowing what is enough. There is no greater fault Than desire for success.\nTherefore, Knowing that enough is enough Is always Enough.\n47\nWithout going out the door, Know the world. Without peeping through the window, See heaven's Tao. The further you travel, The less you know.\nThis is why the Sage Knows without budging, Identifies without looking, Does without trying.\n48\nPursue knowledge, gain daily. Pursue Tao, lose daily. Lose and again lose, Arrive at non-doing.\nNon-doing - and nothing not done.\nTake the entire world as nothing. Make the least effort, And the world escapes you.\n49\nThe Sage has no set heart. Ordinary people's hearts Become the Sage's heart.\nPeople who are good I treat well. People who are not good I also treat well: Te as goodness.\nTrustworthy people I trust. Untrustworthy people I also trust. Te as trust.\nSages create harmony under heaven Blending their hearts with the world. Ordinary people fix their eyes and ears upon them, But Sages become the world's children.\n50\nEmerge into life, enter death,\nLife is only the thirteen body parts. Death is only the thirteen body parts. Human life, moving towards death, Is the same thirteen. Why is this? Because life gives life to substance.\nYou have heard of people Good at holding on to life. Walking overland they don't avoid Rhinos and tigers. In battle they don't arm themselves.\nThe rhino's horn find nothing to gore; The tiger's claws find nothing to flay, Weapons find nothing to pierce. Why is this? They have no mortal spot.\n51\nTao bears them Te nurses them Events form them Energy completes them. Therefore the ten thousand beings Honour Tao and respect Te. Tao is honoured Te is respected Because they do not give orders But endure in their own nature. Therefore, Tao bears them and Te nurses them, Rears them, Raises them, Shelters them, Nurtures them, Supports them, Protects them.\nBears them without owning them, Helps them without coddling them, Rears them without ruling them. This is called original Te.\n52\nThe world has a source: the world's mother. Once you have the mother, You know the children.\nOnce you know the children, Return to the mother. Your body dies. There is no danger.\nBlock the passage, Bolt the gate: No strain Until your life ends.\nOpen the passage, Take charge of things No relief Until your life ends.\nSeeing the small is called brightness Maintaining gentleness is called strength.\nUse this brightness to return to brightness. Don't cling to your body's woes. Then you can learn endurance.\n53\nHaving some knowledge When walking on the Great Tao Only brings fear.\nThe great Tao is very smooth, But people like rough trails.\nThe government is divided, Fields are overgrown, Granaries are empty,.\nBut the nobles clothes are gorgeous, Their belts show off swords, And they are glutted with food and drink. Personal wealth is excessive. This is called thieves' endowment, But it is not Tao.\n54\nWell planted, not uprooted. Well embraced, never lost. Descendants will continue The ancestral rituals.\nMaintain oneself: Te becomes real. Maintain the family: Te becomes abundant. Maintain the community: Te becomes extensive. Maintain the country: Te becomes public. Maintain the world: Te becomes omnipresent.\nTherefore, Through self contemplate self, Through family contemplate family, Through community contemplate community, Through country contemplate country, Through world contemplate world.\nHow do I know the world? Like this!\n55\nBe filled with Te, Like a baby: Wasps, scorpions and vipers Do not sting it. Fierce tigers do not stalk it. Birds of prey do not attack it. Bones weak, muscles soft, But its grasp is tight.\nIt does not yet know Union of male and female, But its sex is formed, Its vital essence complete.\nIt can scream all day and not get hoarse, Its harmony is complete. Knowing harmony is called endurance. Knowing endurance is called illumination.\nIncreasing life is called fortune. Mind controlling energy is called power.\nWhen beings prosper and grow old, Call them not-Tao. Not-Tao soon ends.\n56\nThose who know don't talk. Those who talk don't know.\nBlock the passage Bolt the gate Blunt the sharp Untie the knot Blend with the light Become one with the dust - This is called original unity.\nIt can't be embraced It can't be escaped, It can't be helped It can't be harmed, It can't be exalted It can't be despised, Therefore it is revered under Heaven.\n57\nUse the unexpected to govern the country, Use surprise to wage war, Use non-action to win the world. How do I know? Like this!\nThe more prohibitions and rules, The poorer people become. The sharper people's weapons, The more they riot.\nThe more skilled their techniques, The more grotesque their works. The more elaborate the laws, The more they commit crimes.\nTherefore the Sage says, I do nothing And people transform themselves. I enjoy serenity And people govern themselves.\nI cultivate emptiness And people become prosperous. I have no desires And people simplify themselves.\n58\nIf government is muted and muffled People are cool and refreshed. If government investigates and intrudes, People are worn down and hopeless.\nBad fortune rests upon good fortune. Good luck hides within bad luck.\nWho knows how it will end? If there is no principle Principle reverts to disorder, Good reverts to calamity, People's confusion hardens and lingers on.\nTherefore the Sage squares without cutting, Corners without dividing, Straightens without extending, Shines without dazzling.\n59\nGoverning people and serving heaven Is like living off the land.\nLiving sparingly and responding quickly Means accumulating Te. There is nothing that cannot be overcome. There is no limit.\nYou can become the country And the country's mother, and nourish and extend it.\nThis is called deep roots, firm base. This is the Tao of living long and seeing far.\n60\nGovern big countries Like you cook a little fish.\nWhen Tao harmonizes the world, Demons lose their power.\nNot that demons lose their power, but their power does not harm people. Not that their power does not harm people, but the Sage does not harm people.\nIf neither does harm, Then Te flows and returns.\n61\nA great nation flows down To be the world's pool, The female under heaven In stillness The female constantly overcomes the male, In stillness Takes the low place.\nTherefore a great nation Lowers itself And wins over a small one. A small nation keeps itself low And wins over a great one.\nSometimes becoming low wins, Sometimes staying low wins.\nA great nation desires nothing more Than to unite and protect people. A small nation desires nothing more Than to enter the service of people.\nWhen both get what they wish The great one should be low.\n62\nTao is the mysterious center of all things, a treasure for those who are good, A refuge for those who are not.\nBeautiful words can be traded, Noble deeds can enhance reputations, But if people lack them, Why should they be rejected?\nWhen the Son of Heaven is enthroned And the Three Ministers installed, Presenting jade discs And four-horse chariots Cannot compare to sitting still And offering the Tao.\nThe ancients honoured this Tao. Didn't they say: Through it seekers find, Through it the guilty escape? This is why Tao is honoured under Heaven.\n63\nAct without acting. Serve without serving. Taste without tasting.\nBig, little, Many, few, Repay hatred with Te.\nMap difficult with easy Approach great through narrow.\nThe most difficult things in the world Must be accomplished through the easiest. The greatest things in the world Must be accomplished through the smallest.\nTherefore the Sage Never attempts great things and so accomplishes them.\nQuick promises Mean little trust. Everything easy Means great difficulty.\nThus for the Sage everything is difficult, And so in the end Nothing is difficult.\n64\nAt rest is easy to hold. Not yet impossible is easy to plan. Brittle is easy to break. Fine is easy to scatter.\nCreate before it exists. Lead before it goes astray.\nA tree too big to embrace Is born from a slender shoot. A nine-story rises from a pile of earth. A thousand-mile journey Begins with a single step.\nAct and you ruin it. Grasp and you lose it. Therefore the Sage Does not act And so does not ruin Does not grasp And so does not lose.\nPeople commonly ruin their work When they are near success. Proceed at the end as at the beginning And your work won't be ruined.\nTherefore the Sage Desires no desires Prizes no prizes Studies no studies And returns To what others pass by. The Sage Helps all beings find their nature, But does not presume to act.\n65\nTaoist rulers of old Did not enlighten people But left them dull.\nPeople are difficult to govern Because they are very clever. Therefore, Ruling through cleverness leads to rebellion. Not leading through cleverness Brings good fortune.\nKnow these two things And understanding the enduring pattern. Understand the enduring pattern: This is called original Te.\nOriginal Te goes deep and far. All things reverse Return And reach the great headwaters.\n66\nRivers and seas Can rule the hundred valleys Because they are good at lying low They are lords of the valleys.\nTherefore those who would be above Must speak as if they are below Those who would lead Must speak as if they are behind.\nIn this way the Sage dwells above And the people are not burdened. Dwells in front And they are not hindered. Therefore the whole world Is delighted and unwearied.\nSince the Sage does not contend No one can contend with the Sage.\n67\nEveryone under heaven calls my Tao great, and unlike anything else. It is great only because It is unlike anything else. If it were like anything else It would stretch and become thin.\nI have three treasures to maintain and conserve: the first is compassion. The second is frugality. The third is not presuming To be first under heaven.\nCompassion leads to courage. Frugality allows generosity. Not presuming to be first Creates a lasting instrument.\nNowadays, People reject compassion But want to be brave, Reject frugality But want to be generous, Reject humility And want to come first. This is death.\nCompassion: Attack with it and win. Defend with it and stand firm. Heaven aids and protects Through compassion.\n68\nThe accomplished person is not aggressive. The good soldier is not hot tempered.\nThe best conqueror does not engage the enemy. The most effective leader takes the lowest place.\nThis is called the Te of not contending. This is called the power of the leader. This is called matching Heaven's ancient ideal.\n69\nThere is a saying in the army: I do not presume to be the master, But become the guest. I do not dare advance an inch, but retreat a foot.\nThis is called moving without moving, rolling up sleeves without showing your arms, Repelling without opposing, Wielding without a weapon.\nThere is no disaster greater than Contempt for the enemy.\nContempt for the enemy - what a treasure is lost! Therefore, When the fighting gets hot, Those who grieve will conquer.\n70\nMy words are very easy to understand, Very easy to practice. No one under heaven can understand them, No one can practice them.\nWords have ancestors, Deeds have masters. If people don't understand this, They don't understand me. Few understand me, And that is my value.\nTherefore the Sage wears rough clothing And carries Jade inside.\n71\nKnow not-knowing: supreme. Not know knowing: faulty\nOnly faulting faults is faultless.\nThe Sage is faultless\nBy faulting faults,\nAnd so is without fault.\n72\nWhen people are not in awe of power, Power becomes great.\nDo not intrude into their homes, Do not make their lives weary. If you do not weary them, They will not becoem weary of you.\nTherefore the Sage Has self-knowledge without self-display, Self-love without personal pride, Rejects one, accepts the other.\n73\nCourage to dare kills, Courage not to dare saves. One brings profit, one brings harm.\nOf these two, one is good, and one is harmful. Some are not favored by heaven. Who knows why? Even the wise consider it a difficult question.\nHeaven hates what it hates - Who knows why! Even the Sage finds it difficult. Heaven's Tao does not contend But prevails, Does not speak, But responds, Is not summoned, But arrives, Is utterly still, But plans all actions.\nHeaven's net is wide, wide, Loose - But nothing slips through.\n74\nIf people do not fear death, How dare you threaten them with death?\nBut if people with a normal fear of death Are about to do something vicious, And I could seize and execute them, Who would dare?\nThere is always an official executioner. Trying to take the executioner's place, Is like trying to replace a master woodworker - Few would not slice their own hands.\n75\nPeople are hungry. When rulers tax grain People are hungry.\nPeople are rebellious. When rulers are active People are rebellious.\nPeople ignore death. When searching only for life's bounty People ignore death. Only those who do not strive after life Truly respect life.\n76\nHumans are born soft and weak. They die stiff and strong.\nThe ten thousand plants and trees Are born soft tender, And die withered and sere.\nThe stiff and strong Are Death's companions The soft and weak Are Life's companions.\nTherefore the strongest armies do not conquer, The greatest trees are cut down.\nThe strong and great sink down. The soft and weak rise up.\n77\nHeaven's Tao Is a stretched bow, Pulling down on the top Pulling up on the bottom.\nIf it's too much, cut. If it's not enough, Add on to it: Heaven's Tao.\nThe Human Route Is not like this, Depriving the poor, Offering to the rich. Who has a surplus And still offers it to the world? Only those with Tao.\nTherefore the Sage Acts and expects nothing, Accomplishes and does not linger, Has no desire to seem worthy.\n78\nNothing in the world is soft and weak as water. But when attacking the hard and strong Nothing can conquer so easily.\nWeak overcomes strong, soft overcomes hard. Everyone knows this, no one attains it.\nTherefore the Sage says: Accept a country's filth And become master of its sacred soil. Accepts country's ill fortune And become king under heaven. True words resemble their opposites.\n79\nAppears great hatred sand hatred will remain. How can this be good?\nTherefore the Sage Holds the tally But does not judge people.\nThose who have Te Control the tally. Those who lack Te Collect their due.\nHeaven has no favourites But endures in good people.\n80\nSmall country, few people - Hundreds of devices, But none are used. People ponder on death And don't travel far.\nThey have carriages and boats, But no one goes on board; Weapons and armour, But no one brandishes them.\nThey use knotted cords for counting. Sweet is their food, Beautiful their clothes, Peaceful their homes, Delightful their customs.\nNeighboring countries are so close You can hear their chickens and dogs. But people grow old and die Without needing to come and go.\n81\nSincere words and not pretty. Pretty words are not sincere.\nGood people do not quarrel. Quarrelsome people are not good.\nThe wise are not learned. The learned are not wise.\nThe Sage is not acquisitive - Has enough By doing for others, Has even more By giving to others.\nHeaven's Tao Benefits and does not harm. The Sage's Tao Acts and does not contend.\n
