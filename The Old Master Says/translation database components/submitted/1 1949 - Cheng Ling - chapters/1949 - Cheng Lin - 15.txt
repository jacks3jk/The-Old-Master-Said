1	15	The ancients who knew how to live according to Truth possessed a subtle and penetrating intelligence. The profundity of their character was immeasurable. As it was immeasurable, we can only give a superficial description of them as follows: They moved about cautiously as though they were fording a large stream of water. They were retiring and hesitant as though they were shy of the men around them. Their demeanour was reverent as though they were meeting honoured guests. They quickly adapted themselves to any circumstance as though they were ice melting before fire. Their manners were simple and artless as though they were unhewn wood. Their minds were expansive and receptive as though they were hollow valley. Their views were impartial and tolerant as though they were turbid puddles. What is it that can end the turbidity of puddles? When there is no disturbance, the impurities gradually settle, and the water becomes clear. What is it that can perpetuate the continuity of things? When there is constant change, life gradually undergoes growth. Those who hold fast to Truth do not desire satiation. Because there is no satiety, life is continually renewing itself.
