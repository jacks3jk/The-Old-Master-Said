3
When talents are not esteemed, men will not strive to excel one another.
When wealth is not treasured, men will not attempt to rob one another.
When the objects of sensual satisfaction disappear, men's minds are free from distraction and confusion.
Wherefore the Sage, as regards government, wishes only that it will enable men to be humble at heart, well-fed in body, free from sensuous desires, and strong in physique.
When the people are free of cunning, desires, and artifice, there must be good order.
