Those who amass wealth without ceasing are comparable to one who continues to temper a weapon until it loses its keenness.
A house that is filled with gold and jades cannot long remain secure.
A man who proudly displays his riches invites trouble for himself.
The effacement of self after success has been achieved is the way of Heaven.
