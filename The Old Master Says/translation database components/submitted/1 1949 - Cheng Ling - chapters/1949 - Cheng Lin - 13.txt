The great trouble of man lies in the love for self.
What is meant by saying that honour and disgrace are alike a cause of excitement?
Man prefers honour to disgrace.
When he has the one, he becomes excited;
when he loses the other, he becomes excited.

What is meant by saying that the great trouble of man lies in the love for self?
Man is beset with great trouble because of his consciousness of self.
If he is selfless, how can there be any trouble?
Wherefore, if a man esteems himself only as much as he esteems the whole world, he will find security therein.
If a man loves the world as much as he loves himself, he will find security therein.
