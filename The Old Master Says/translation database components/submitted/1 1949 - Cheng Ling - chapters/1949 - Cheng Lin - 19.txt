Banish the witty and cunning, and the people will be benefited a hundred-fold.
Cease the teaching of benevolence and righteousness, and the people will again become filial and fraternal.
Discard deceit and greed, and the people will cease to rob one another.
The above three are based on artifice, and are insufficient for good government.
Hence the people should be asked to do the following:
Cherish simplicity and honesty.
Banish selfishness and desires.
Discard learning and fears.
