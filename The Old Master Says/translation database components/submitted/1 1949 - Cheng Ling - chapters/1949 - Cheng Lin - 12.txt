The five colours blind the eyes of man.
The five tones deafen the ears of man.
The five flavours vitiate the palate of man.
The pursuit of pleasures deranges the mind of man.
The love for wealth perverts the conduct of man.
Wherefore the Sage attends to the inner self, and not to the outward appearance.
