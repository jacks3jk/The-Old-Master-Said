Nothingness is used to denote the state that existed before the birth of heaven and earth. Reality is used to denote the state where the multitude of things begins to have a separate existence. Therefore,when the mind rests in the state of Nothingness, the enigma can be understood; when the mind rests in the state of Reality, the bounds can be reached. These two states, though bearing different names, have a common origin. Both are mysterious and metaphysical. They are the most mysterious, and form the gateway to all mysteries.
