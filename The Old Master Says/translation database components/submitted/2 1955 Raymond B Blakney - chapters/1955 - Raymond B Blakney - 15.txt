2	1\nThere are ways but the Way is uncharted;\nThere are names but not nature in words:\nNameless indeed is the source of creation\nBut things have a mother and she has a name.\n\nThe secret waits for the insight\nOf eyes unclouded by longing;\nThose who are bound by desire\nSee only the outward container.\n\nThese two come paired but distinct\nBy their names.\nOf all things profound,\nSay that their pairing is deepest,\nThe gate to the root of the world.\n\n\n\n2\nSince the world points up beauty as such,\nThere is ugliness too.\nIf goodness is taken as goodness,\nWickedness enters as well.\n\nFor is and is-not come together;\nHard and easy are complementary;\nLong and short are relative;\nHigh and low are comparative;\nPitch and sound make harmony;\nBefore and after are a sequence.\n\nIndeed the Wise Man's office\nIs to work by being still;\nHe teaches not by speech\nBut by accomplishment;\nHe does for everything,\nNeglecting none;\nTheir life he gives to all,\nPossessing none;\nAnd what he brings to pass\nDepends on no one else.\nAs he succeeds,\nHe takes no credit\nAnd just because he does not take it,\nCredit never leaves him.\n\n\n\n3\nIf those who are excellent find no preferment,\nThe people will cease to contend for promotion.\nIf goods that are hard to obtain are not favored,\nThe people will cease to turn robbers or bandits.\nIf things much desired are kept under cover,\nDisturbance will cease in the minds of the people.\n\nThe Wise Man's policy, accordingly,\nWill be to empty people's hearts and minds,\nTo fill their bellies, weaken their ambition,\nGive them sturdy frames and always so,\nTo keep them uninformed, without desire,\nAnd knowing ones not venturing to act.\n\nBe still while you work\nAnd keep full control\nOver all.\n\n \n\n\n4\nThe Way is a void,\nUsed but never filled:\nAn abyss it is,\nLike an ancestor\nFrom which all things come.\n\nIt blunts sharpness,\nResolves tangles;\nIt tempers light,\nSubdues turmoil.\n\nA deep pool it is,\nNever to run dry!\nWhose offspring it may be\nI do not know:\nIt is like a preface to God.\n\n \n\n\n5\nIs then the world unkind?\nAnd does it treat all things\nLike straw dogs used in magic rites?\nThe Wise Man too, is he unkind?\nAnd does he treat the folk\nLike straw dogs made to throw away?\n\nBetween the earth and sky\nThe space is like a bellows,\nEmpty but unspent.\nWhen moved its gift is copious.\n\nMuch talk means much exhaustion;\nBetter far it is to keep your thoughts!\n\n \n\n\n6\nThe valley spirit is not dead:\nThey say it is the mystic female.\nHer gateway is, they further say,\nThe base of heaven and earth.\n\nConstantly, and so forever,\nUse her without labor.\n\n \n\n\n7\nThe sky is everlasting\nAnd the earth is very old.\nWhy so? Because the world\nExists not for itself;\nIt can and will live on.\n\nThe Wise Man chooses to be last\nAnd so becomes the first of all;\nDenying self, he too is saved.\nFor does he not fulfillment find\nIn being an unselfish man?\n\n \n\n\n8\nThe highest goodness, water-like,\nDoes good to everything and goes\nUnmurmuring to places men despise;\nBut so, is close in nature to the Way.\n\nIf the good of the house is from land,\nOr the good of the mind is depth,\nOr love is the virtue of friendship,\nOr honesty blesses one's talk,\nOr in government, goodness is order,\nOr in business, skill is admired,\nOr the worth of an act lies in timing,\nThen peace is the goal of the Way\nBy which no one ever goes astray.\n\n \n\n\n9\nTo take all you want\nIs never as good\nAs to stop when you should.\nScheme and be sharp\nAnd you'll not keep it long.\nOne can never guard\nHis home when it's full\nOf jade and fine gold:\nWealth, power and pride\nBequeath their own doom.\nWhen fame and success\nCome to you, then retire.\nThis is the ordained Way.\n\n \n\n\n10\nCan you govern your animal soul, hold to the One and\n\nnever depart from it?\nCan you throttle your breath, down to the softness of\nbreath in a child?\nCan you purify your mystic vision and wash it until it is\nspotless?\nCan you love all your people, rule over the land without\nbeing known?\nCan you be like a female, and passively open and shut\nheaven's gates?\nCan you keep clear in your mind the four quarters of earth\nand not interfere?\n\nQuicken them, feed them;\nQuicken but do not possess them.\nAct and be independent;\nBe the chief but never the lord:\nThis describes the mystic virtue.\n\n \n\n\n11\nThirty spokes will converge\nIn the hub of a wheel;\nBut the use of the cart\nWill depend on the part\nOf the hub that is void.\n\nWith a wall all around A clay bowl is molded;\nBut the use of the bowl\nWill depend on the part\nOf the bowl that is void.\n\nCut out windows and doors\nIn the house as you build;\nBut the use of the house\nWill depend on the space\nIn the walls that is void.\n\nSo advantage is had\nFrom whatever is there;\nBut usefulness rises\nFrom whatever is not.\n\n \n\n\n12\nThe five colors darken the eye;\nThe five sounds will deaden the ear;\nThe five flavors weary the taste;\nChasing the beasts of the field\nWill drive a man mad.\nThe goods that are hard to procure\nAre hobbles that slow walking feet.\n\nSo the Wise Man will do What his belly dictates\nAnd never the sight of his eyes.\nThus he will choose this but not that.\n\n \n\n\n13\n"Favor, like disgrace\nBrings trouble with it;\nHigh rank, like self,\nInvolves acute distress."\n\nWhat does that mean, to say\nThat "favor, like disgrace\nBrings trouble with it"?\nWhen favor is bestowed\nOn one of low degree,\n\nTrouble will come with it.\nThe loss of favor too\nMeans trouble for that man.\nThis, then, is what is meant\nBy "favor, like disgrace\nBrings trouble with it."\n\nWhat does it mean, to say\nThat "rank, like self,\nInvolves acute distress"?\nI suffer most because\nOf me and selfishness.\nIf I were selfless, then\nWhat suffering would I bear?\n\nIn governing the world,\nLet rule entrusted be\nTo him who treats his rank\nAs if it were his soul;\nWorld sovereignty can be\nCommitted to that man\nWho loves all people\nAs he loves himself.\n\n \n\n\n14\nThey call it elusive, and say\nThat one looks\nBut it never appears.\nThey say that indeed it is rare,\nSince one listens,\nBut never a sound.\nSubtle, they call it, and say\nThat one grasps it\nBut never gets hold.\nThese three complaints amount\nTo only one, which is\nBeyond all resolution.\n\nAt rising, it does not illumine;\nAt setting, no darkness ensues;\nIt stretches far back\nTo that nameless estate\nWhich existed before the creation.\n\nDescribe it as form yet unformed;\nAs shape that is still without shape;\nOr say it is vagueness confused:\nOne meets it and it has no front;\nOne follows and there is no rear.\n\nIf you hold ever fast\nTo that most ancient Way,\nYou may govern today.\nCall truly that knowledge\nOf primal beginnings\nThe clue to the Way.\n\n \n\n\n15\nThe excellent masters of old,\nSubtle, mysterious, mystic, acute,\nWere much too profound for their times.\nSince they were not then understood,\nIt is better to tell how they looked.\n\nLike men crossing streams in the winter,\n\nHow cautious!\nAs if all around there were danger,\n\nHow watchful!\nAs if they were guests on every occasion,\n\nHow dignified!\nLike ice just beginning to melt,\n\nSelf-effacing!\nLike a wood-block untouched by a tool,\n\nHow sincere!\nLike a valley awaiting a guest,\n\nHow receptive!\nLike a torrent that rushes along,\n\nAnd so turbid!\n\nWho, running dirty, comes clean like still waters?\nWho, being quiet, moves others to fullness of life?\nIt is he who, embracing the Way, is not greedy;\nWho endures wear and tear without needing renewal.\n\n \n\n\n16\nTouch ultimate emptiness,\nHold steady and still.\n\nAll things work together:\nI have watched them reverting,\nAnd have seen how they flourish\nAnd return again, each to his roots.\n\nThis, I say, is the stillness:\nA retreat to one's roots;\nOr better yet, return\nTo the will of God,\nWhich is, I say, to constancy.\nThe knowledge of constancy\nI call enlightenment and say\nThat not to know it\nIs blindness that works evil.\n\nBut when you know\nWhat eternally is so,\nYou have stature\nAnd stature means righteousness\nAnd righteousness is kingly\nAnd kingliness divine\nAnd divinity is the Way\nWhich is final.\n\nThen, though you die,\nYou shall not perish.\n\n \n\n\n17\nAs for him who is highest,\nThe people just know he is there.\nHis deputy's cherished and praised;\nOf the third, they are frightened;\nThe fourth, they despise and revile.\nIf you trust people less than enough,\nSome of them never trust you.\n\nHe is aloof, as if his talk\nWere priced beyond the purchasing;\nBut once his project is contrived,\nThe folk will want to say of it:\n"Of course! We did it by ourselves!"\n\n \n\n\n18\nThe mighty Way declined among the folk\nAnd then came kindness and morality.\nWhen wisdom and intelligence appeared,\nThey brought with them a great hypocrisy.\nThe six relations were no more at peace,\nSo codes were made to regulate our homes.\nThe fatherland grew dark, confused by strife:\nOfficial loyalty became the style.\n\n \n\n\n19\nGet rid of the wise men!\nPut out the professors!\nThen people will profit\nA hundredfold over.\nAway with the kind ones;\nThose righteous men too!\nAnd let people return\nTo the graces of home.\nRoot out the artisans;\nBanish the profiteers!\nAnd bandits and robbers\nWill not come to plunder.\n\nBut if these three prove not enough\nTo satisfy the mind and heart,\nMore relevant, then, let there be\nA visible simplicity of life,\nEmbracing unpretentious ways,\nAnd small self-interest\nAnd poverty of coveting.\n\n \n\n\n20\nBe done with rote learning\nAnd its attendant vexations;\nFor is there distinction\nOf a "yes" from a "yea"\nComparable now to the gulf\nBetween evil and good?\n"What all men fear, I too must fear"-\nHow barren and pointless a thought!\n\nThe reveling of multitudes\nAt the feast of Great Sacrifice,\nOr up on the terrace\nAt carnival in spring,\nLeave me, alas, unmoved, alone,\nLike a child that has never smiled.\n\nLazily, I drift\nAs though I had no home.\nAll others have enough to spare;\nI am the one left out.\nI have the mind of a fool,\nMuddled and confused!\nWhen common people scintillate\nI alone make shadows.\nVulgar folks are sharp and knowing:\nOnly I am melancholy.\nRestless like the ocean,\nBlown about, I cannot stop.\nOther men can find employment,\nBut I am stubborn; I am mean.\n\nAlone I am and different,\nBecause I prize and seek\nMy sustenance from the Mother!\n\n \n\n\n21\nThe omnipresent Virtue will take shape\nAccording only to the Way.\nThe Way itself is like some thing\nSeen in a dream, elusive, evading one.\nIn it are images, elusive, evading one.\nIn it are things like shadows in twilight.\nIn it are essences, subtle but real,\nEmbedded in truth.\n\nFrom of old until now,\nUnder names without end,\nThe First, the Beginning is seen.\nHow do I know the beginning of all,\nWhat its nature may be?\nBy these!\n\n \n\n\n22\nThe crooked shall be made straight\nAnd the rough places plain;\nThe pools shall be filled\nAnd the worn renewed;\nThe needy shall receive\nAnd the rich shall be perplexed.\n\nSo the Wise Man cherishes the One,\nAs a standard to the world:\nNot displaying himself,\nHe is famous;\nNot asserting himself,\nHe is distinguished;\nNot boasting his powers,\nHe is effective;\nTaking no pride in himself,\nHe is chief.\n\nBecause he is no competitor,\nNo one in all the world\ncan compete with him.\n\nThe saying of the men of old\nIs not in vain:\n"The crooked shall be made straight-"\nTo be perfect, return to it.\n\n \n\n\n23\nSparing indeed is nature of its talk:\nThe whirlwind will not last the morning out;\nThe cloudburst ends before the day is done.\nWhat is it that behaves itself like this?\nThe earth and sky! And if it be that these\nCut short their speech, how much more yet should man!\n\nIf you work by the Way,\nYou will be of the Way;\nIf you work through its virtue\nyou will be given the virtue;\nAbandon either one\nAnd both abandon you.\n\nGladly then the Way receives\nThose who choose to walk in it;\nGladly too its power upholds\nThose who choose to use it well;\nGladly will abandon greet\nThose who to abandon drift.\n\nLittle faith is put in them\nWhose faith is small.\n\n \n\n\n24\nOn tiptoe your stance is unsteady;\nLong strides make your progress unsure;\nShow off and you get no attention;\nYour boasting will mean you have failed;\nAsserting yourself brings no credit;\nBe proud and you will never lead.\n\nTo persons of the Way, these traits\nCan only bring distrust; they seem\nLike extra food for parasites.\nSo those who choose the Way,\nWill never give them place.\n\n \n\n \n\n25\nSomething there is, whose veiled creation was\nBefore the earth or sky began to be;\nSo silent, so aloof and so alone,\nIt changes not, nor fails, but touches all:\nConceive it as the mother of the world.\n\nI do not know its name:\nA name for it is "Way";\nPressed for designation,\nI call it Great.\nGreat means outgoing,\nOutgoing, far-reaching,\nFar-reaching, return.\n\nThe Way is great,\nThe sky is great,\nThe earth is great,\nThe king also is great.\nWithin the realm\nThese four are great;\nThe king but stands\nFor one of them.\n\nMan conforms to the earth;\nThe earth conforms to the sky;\nThe sky conforms to the Way;\nThe Way conforms to its own nature.\n\n \n\n\n26\nThe heavy is foundation for the light;\nSo quietness is master of the deed.\n\nThe Wise Man, though he travel all the day,\nWill not be separated from his goods.\nSo even if the scene is glorious to view,\nHe keeps his place, at peace, above it all.\n\nFor how can one who rules\nTen thousand chariots\nGive up to lighter moods\nAS all the world may do?\nIf he is trivial,\nHis ministers are lost;\nIf he is strenuous,\nThere is no master then.\n\n \n\n\n27\nA good runner leaves no tracks.\nA good speech has no flaws to censure.\nA good computer uses no tallies.\nA good door is well shut without bolts and cannot be opened.\nA good knot is tied without rope and cannot be loosed.\n\nThe Wise Man is always good at helping people,\nso that none are cast out;\nhe is always good at saving things,\nso that none are thrown away.\nThis is called applied intelligence.\n\nSurely the good man is the bad man's teacher;\nand the bad man is the good man's business.\nIf the one does not respect his teacher,\nor the other doesn't love his business,\nhis error is very great.\n\nThis is indeed an important secret.\n\n \n\n\n28\nBe aware of your masculine nature;\nBut by keeping the feminine way,\nYou shall be to the world like a canyon,\nWhere the Virtue eternal abides,\nAnd go back to become as a child.\n\nBe aware of the white all around you;\nBut remembering the black that is there,\nYou shall be to the world like a tester,\nWhom the Virtue eternal, unerring,\nRedirects to the infinite past.\n\nBe aware of your glory and honor;\nBut in never relinquishing shame,\nYou shall be to the world like a valley,\nWhere Virtue eternal, sufficient,\nSends you back to the Virginal Block.\n\nWhen the Virginal Block is asunder,\nAnd is made into several tools,\nTo the ends of the Wise Man directed,\nThey become then his chief officers:\nFor "The Master himself does not carve."\n\n \n\n\n29\nAs for those who would take the whole world\nTo tinker as they see fit,\nI observe that they never succeed:\nFor the world is a sacred vessel\nNot to be altered by man.\nThe tinker will spoil it;\nUsurpers will lose it.\n\nFor indeed there are things\nThat must move ahead,\nWhile others must lag;\nAnd some that feel hot,\nWhile others feel cold;\nAnd some that are strong,\nWhile others are weak;\nAnd vigorous ones,\nWhile others worn out.\n\nSo the Wise Man discards\nExtreme inclinations\nTo make sweeping judgments,\nOr to a life of excess.\n\n \n\n\n30\nTo those who would help\nThe ruler of men\nBy means of the Way:\n\nLet him not with his militant might\nTry to conquer the world;\nThis tactic is like to recoil.\nFor where armies have marched,\nThere do briars spring up;\nWhere great hosts are impressed,\nYears of hunger and evil ensue.\n\nThe good man's purpose once attained,\nHe stops at that;\nHe will not press for victory.\nHis point once made, he does not boast,\nOr celebrate the goal he gained,\nOr proudly indicate the spoils.\nHe won the day because he must:\nBut not by force or violence.\n\nThat things with age decline in strength,\nYou well may say, suits not the Way;\nAnd not to suit the Way is early death.\n\n \n\n\n31\nWeapons at best are tools of bad omen,\nLoathed and avoided by those of the Way.\n\nIn the usage of men of good breeding,\nHonor is had at the left;\nGood omens belong on the left\nBad omens belong on the right;\nAnd warriors press to the right!\nWhen the general stands at the right\nHis lieutenant is placed at the left.\nSo the usage of men of great power\nFollows that of the funeral rite.\n\nWeapons are tools of bad omen,\nBy gentlemen not to be used;\nBut when it cannot be avoided,\nThey use them with calm and restraint.\nEven in victory's hour\nThese tools are unlovely to see;\nFor those who admire them truly\nAre men who in murder delight.\n\nAs for those who delight to do murder,\nIt is certain they never can get\nFrom the world what they sought when ambition\nUrged them to power and rule.\n\nA multitude slain!- and their death\nIs a matter for grief and for tears;\nThe victory after a conflict\nIs a theme for a funeral rite.\n\n \n\n\n32\nThe Way eternal has no name.\nA block of wood untooled, though small,\nMay still excel the world.\nAnd if the king and nobles could\nRetain its potency for good,\nThen everything would freely give\nAllegiance to their rule.\n\nThe earth and sky would then conspire\nTo bring the sweet dew down;\nAnd evenly it would be given\nTo folk without constraining power.\n\nCreatures came to be with order's birth,\nAnd once they had appeared,\nCame also knowledge of repose,\nAnd with that was security.\n\nIn this world,\nCompare those of the Way\nTo torrents that flow\nInto river and sea.\n\n \n\n\n33\nIt is wisdom to know others;\nIt is enlightenment to know one's self.\n\nThe conqueror of men is powerful;\nThe master of himself is strong.\n\nIt is wealth to be content;\nIt is willful to force one's way on others.\n\nEndurance is to keep one's place;\nLong life it is to die and not perish.\n\n \n\n\n34\nO the great Way o'erflows\nAnd spreads on every side!\nAll beings come from it;\nNo creature is denied.\nBut having called them forth,\nIt calls not one its own.\nIt feeds and clothes them all\nAnd will not be their lord.\nWithout desire always,\nIt seems of slight import.\nYet, nonetheless, in this\nIts greatness still appears:\nWhen they return to it,\nNo creature meets a lord.\n\nThe Wise Man, therefore, while he is alive,\nWill never make a show of being great:\nAnd that is how his greatness is achieved.\n\n \n\n\n35\nOnce grasp the great Form without form,\nAnd you roam where you will\nWith no evil to fear,\nCalm, peaceful, at ease.\n\nAt music and viands\nThe wayfarer stops.\nBut the Way, when declared,\nSeems thin and so flavorless!\n\nIt is nothing to look at\nAnd nothing to hear;\nBut used, it will prove\nInexhaustible.\n\n \n\n\n36\nWhat is to be shrunken\nIs first stretched out;\nWhat is to be weakened\nIs first made strong;\nWhat will be thrown over\nIs first raised up;\nWhat will be withdrawn\nIs first bestowed.\n\nThis indeed is\nSubtle Light;\nThe gentle way\nWill overcome\nThe hard and strong.\nAs fish should not\nGet out of pools,\nThe realm's edged tools\nShould not be shown\nTo anybody.\n\n \n\n\n37\nThe Way is always still, at rest,\nAnd yet does everything that's done.\nIf then the king and nobles could\nRetain its potency for good,\nThe creatures all would be transformed.\n\nBut if, the change once made in them,\nThey still inclined to do their work,\nI should restrain them then\nBy means of that unique\nOriginal simplicity\nFound in the Virgin Block,\nWhich brings disinterest,\nWith stillness in its train,\nAnd so, an ordered world.\n\n \n\n\n38\nA man of highest virtue\nWill not display it as his own;\nHis virtue then is real.\nLow virtue makes one miss no chance\nTo show his virtue off;\nHis virtue then is naught.\nHigh virtue is at rest;\nIt knows no need to act.\nLow virtue is a busyness\nPretending to accomplishment.\n\nCompassion at its best\nConsists in honest deeds;\nMorality at best\nIs something done, aforethought;\nHigh etiquette, when acted out\nWithout response from others,\nConstrains a man to bare his arms\nAnd make them do their duty!\n\nTruly, once the Way is lost,\nThere comes then virtue;\nVirtue lost, comes then compassion;\nAfter that morality;\nAnd when that's lost, there's etiquette,\nThe husk of all good faith,\nThe rising point of anarchy.\n\nForeknowledge is, they say,\nThe Doctrine come to flower;\nBut better yet, it is\nThe starting point of silliness.\nSo once full-grown, a man will take\nThe meat and not the husk,\nThe fruit and not the flower.\nRejecting one, he takes the other.\n\n \n\n\n39\nThese things in ancient times received the One:\n\nThe sky obtained it and was clarified;\nThe earth received it and was settled firm;\nThe spirits got it and were energized;\nThe valleys had it, filled to overflow;\nAll things, as they partook it came alive;\nThe nobles and the king imbibed the One\nIn order that the realm might upright be;\nSuch things were then accomplished by the One.\n\nWithout its clarity the sky might break;\nExcept it were set firm, the earth might shake;\nWithout their energy the gods would pass;\nUnless kept full, the valleys might go dry;\nExcept for life, all things would pass away;\nUnless the One did lift and hold them high,\nThe nobles and the king might trip and fall.\n\nThe humble folk support the mighty ones;\nThey are base on which the highest rest.\nThe nobles and the king speak of themselves\nAs "orphans," "desolate" and "needy ones."\nDoes this not indicate that they depend\nUpon the lowly people for support?\n\nTruly a cart is more than the sum of its parts.\n\nBetter to rumble like rocks\nThan to tinkle like jade.\n\n \n\n\n40\nThe movement of the Way is a return;\nIn weakness lies its major usefulness.\nFrom What-is all the world of things was born\nBut What-is sprang in turn from What-is-not.\n\n \n\n\n41\nOn hearing of the Way, the best of men\nWill earnestly explore its length.\nThe mediocre person learns of it\nAnd takes it up and sets it down.\nBut vulgar people, when they hear the news,\nWill laugh out loud, and if they did not laugh,\nIt would not be the Way.\n\nAnd so there is a proverb:\n"When going looks like coming back,\nThe clearest road is mighty dark."\n\nToday, the Way that's plain looks rough,\nAnd lofty virtue like a chasm;\nThe purest innocence like shame,\nThe broadest power not enough,\nEstablished goodness knavery,\nSubstantial worth like shifting tides.\nGreat space has no corners;\nGreat powers come late;\nGreat music is soft sound;\nThe great Form no shape.\n\nThe Way is obscure and unnamed;\nIt is a skilled investor, nonetheless,\nThe master of accomplishment.\n\n \n\n\n42\nThe Way begot one,\nAnd the one, two;\nThen the two begot three\nAnd three, all else.\n\nAll things bear the shade on their backs\nAnd the sun in their arms;\nBy the blending of breath\nFrom the sun and the shade,\nEquilibrium comes to the world.\n\nOrphaned, or needy, or desolate, these\nAre conditions much feared and disliked;\nYet in public address, the king\nAnd the nobles account themselves thus.\nSo a loss sometimes benefits one\nOr a benefit proves to be loss.\n\nWhat others have taught\nI also shall teach:\nIf a violent man does not come\nTo a violent death,\nI shall choose him to teach me.\n\n \n\n\n43\nThe softest of stuff in the world\nPenetrates quickly the hardest;\nInsubstantial, it enters\nWhere no room is.\n\nBy this I know the benefit\nOf something done by quiet being;\nIn all the world but few can know\nAccomplishment apart from work,\nInstruction when no words are used.\n\n \n\n\n44\nWhich is dearer, fame or self?\nWhich is worth more, man or pelf?\nWhich would hurt more, gain or loss?\n\nThe mean man pays the highest price;\nThe hoarder takes the greatest loss;\nA man content is never shamed,\nAnd self-restrained, is not in danger:\nHe will live forever.\n\n \n\n\n45\nMost perfect, yet it seems\nImperfect, incomplete:\nIts use is not impaired.\nFilled up, and yet it seems\nPoured out, an empty void:\nIt never will run dry.\n\nThe straightest, yet it seems\nTo deviate, to bend;\nThe highest skill and yet\nIt looks like clumsiness.\nThe utmost eloquence,\nIt sounds like stammering.\n\nAs movement overcomes\nThe cold, and stillness, heat,\nThe Wise Man, pure and still,\nWill rectify the world.\n\n \n\n\n46\nWhen the Way rules the world,\nCoach horses fertilize the fields;\nWhen the Way does not rule,\nWar horses breed in the parks.\n\nNo sin can exceed\nIncitement to envy;\nNo calamity's worse\nThan to be discontented,\nNor is there an omen\nMore dreadful than coveting.\nBut once be contented,\nAnd truly you'll always be so.\n\n \n\n\n47\nThe world may be known\nWithout leaving the house;\nThe Way may be seen\nApart from the windows.\nThe further you go,\nThe less you will know.\n\nAccordingly, the Wise Man\nKnows without going,\nSees without seeing,\nDoes without doing.\n\n \n\n\n48\nThe student learns by daily increment.\nThe Way is gained by daily loss,\nLoss upon loss until\nAt last comes rest.\n\nBy letting go, it all gets done;\nThe world is won by those who let it go!\nBut when you try and try,\nThe world is then beyond the winning.\n\n \n\n\n49\nThe Wise Man's mind is free\nBut tuned to people's need:\n\n"Alike to be good and bad\nI must be good,\nFor Virtue is goodness.\nTo honest folk\nAnd those dishonest ones\nAlike, I proffer faith,\nFor Virtue is faithful."\n\nThe Wise Man, when abroad,\nImpartial to the world,\nDoes not divide or judge.\nBut people everywhere\nMark well his ears and eyes;\nFor wise men hear and see\nAs little children do.\n\n \n\n50\nOn leaving life, to enter death:\nThirteen members form a living body;\nA corpse has thirteen, too:\nThirteen spots by which a man may pass\nFrom life to death. Why so?\nBecause his way of life\nIs much too gross.\n\nAs I have heard, the man who knows\nOn land how best to be at peace\nWill never meet a tiger or a buffalo;\nIn battle, weapons do not touch his skin.\nThere is no place the tiger's claws can grip;\nOr with his horn, the buffalo can jab;\nOr where the soldier can insert his sword.\nWhy so? In him there is no place of death.\n\n \n\n\n51\nThe Way brings forth,\nIts virtue fosters them,\nWith matter they take shape,\nAnd circumstance perfects them all:\n\nThat is why all things\nDo honor the Way\nAnd venerate its power.\n\nThe exaltation of the Way,\nThe veneration of its power,\nCome not by fate or decree;\nBut always just because\nBy nature it is so.\n\nSo when the Way brings forth,\nIts power fosters all:\nThey grow, are reared,\nAnd fed and housed until\nThey come to ripe maturity.\n\nYou shall give life to things\nBut never possess them;\nYour work shall depend on none;\nYou shall be chief but never lord.\nThis describes the mystic power.\n \n \n\n \n\n52\nIt began with a matrix:\nThe world had a mother\nWhose sons can be known\nAs ever, by her.\nBut if you know them,\nYou'll keep close to her\nAs long as you live\nAnd suffer no harm.\n\nStop up your senses;\nClose up your doors;\nBe not exhausted\nAs long as you live.\nOpen your senses;\nBe busier still:\nTo the end of your days\nThere's no help for you.\n\nYou are bright, it is said,\nIf you see what is small;\nA store of small strengths\nMakes you strong.\nBy the use of its light,\nMake your eyes again bright\nFrom evil to lead you away.\n\nThis is called "practicing constancy."\n\n \n\n\n53\nWhen I am walking on the mighty Way,\nLet me but know the very least I may,\nAnd I shall only fear to leave the road.\nThe mighty Way is easy underfoot,\nBut people still prefer the little paths.\n\nThe royal court is dignified, sedate,\nWhile farmers' fields are overgrown with weeds;\nThe granaries are empty and yet they\nAre clad in rich-embroidered silken gowns.\nThey have sharp swords suspended at their sides;\nWith glutted wealth, they gorge with food and drink.\n\nIt is, the people say,\nThe boastfulness of brigandage,\nBut surely not the Way!\n\n \n\n\n54\nSet firm in the Way: none shall uproot you;\nCherish it well and none shall estrange you;\nYour children's children faithful shall serve\nYour forebears at the altar of your house.\n\nCultivate the Way yourself,\n\nand your Virtue will be genuine.\nCultivate it in the home,\n\nand its Virtue will overflow.\nCultivate it in the village,\n\nand the village will endure.\nCultivate it in the realm,\nand the realm will flourish.\nCultivate it in the world,\nand Virtue will be universal.\n\nAccordingly,\nOne will be judged by the Man of the Way;\nHomes will be viewed through the Home of the Way;\nAnd the Village shall measure the village;\nAnd the Realm, for all realms, shall be standard;\nAnd the World, to this world, shall be heaven.\nHow do I know the world is like this?\nBy this.\n\n \n\n\n55\nRich in virtue, like an infant,\nNoxious insects will not sting him;\nWild beasts will not attack his flesh\nNor birds of prey sink claws in him.\n\nHis bones are soft, his sinews weak,\nHis grip is nonetheless robust;\nOf sexual union unaware,\nHis organs all completely formed,\nHis vital force is at its height.\nHe shouts all day, does not get hoarse:\nHis person is a harmony.\n\nHarmony experienced is known as constancy;\nConstancy experienced is called enlightenment;\nExuberant vitality is ominous, they say;\nA bent for vehemence is called aggressiveness.\n\nThat things with age decline in strength,\nYou well may say, suits not the Way;\nAnd not to suit the Way is early death.\n\n \n\n\n56\nThose who know do not talk\nAnd talkers do not know.\n\nStop your senses,\nClose the doors;\nLet sharp things be blunted,\nTangles resolved,\nThe light tempered\nAnd turmoil subdued;\nFor this is mystic unity\nIn which the Wise Man is moved\nNeither by affection\nNor yet by estrangement\nOr profit or loss\nOr honor or shame.\nAccordingly, by all the world,\nHe is held highest.\n\n \n\n\n57\n"Govern the realm by the right,\nAnd battles by stratagem."\n\nThe world is won by refraining.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this:\n\nAs taboos increase, people grow poorer;\nWhen weapons abound, the state grows chaotic;\nWhere skills multiply, novelties flourish;\nAs statutes increase, more criminals start.\n\nSo the Wise Man will say:\n\nAs I refrain, the people will reform:\nSince I like quiet, they will keep order;\nWhen I forebear, the people will prosper;\nWhen I want nothing, they will be honest.\n\n \n\n\n58\nListlessly govern:\nHappy your people;\nGovern exactingly:\nRestless your people.\n\n"Bad fortune will\nPromote the good;\nGood fortune, too,\nGives rise to the bad."\n\nBut who can know to what that leads?\nFor it is wrong and would assign\nTo right the strangest derivations\nAnd would mean that goodness\nIs produced by magic means!\nHas man thus been so long astray?\n\nAccordingly, the Wise Man\nIs square but not sharp,\nHonest but not malign,\nStraight but not severe,\nBright but not dazzling.\n\n \n\n\n59\n"For ruling men or serving God,\nThere's nothing else like stores saved up."\n\nBy "stores saved up" is meant forehandedness,\nAccumulate Virtue, such that nothing\nCan resist it and its limit\nNone can guess: such infinite resource\nAllows the jurisdiction of the king;\nWhose kingdom then will long endure\nIf it provides the Mother an abode.\nIndeed it is the deeply rooted base,\nThe firm foundation of the Way\nTo immortality of self and name.\n\n \n\n\n60\nRule a large country\nAs small fish are cooked.\n\nThe evil spirits of the world\nLose sanction as divinities\nWhen government proceeds\nAccording to the Way;\nBut even if they do not lose\nTheir ghostly countenance and right,\nThe people take no harm from them;\nAnd if the spirits cannot hurt the folk,\nThe Wise Man surely does no hurt to them.\n\nSince then the Wise Man and the people\nHarm each other not at all,\nTheir several virtues should converge.\n\n \n\n\n61\nThe great land is a place\nTo which the streams descend;\nIt is the concourse and\nThe female of the world:\nQuiescent, underneath,\nIt overcomes the male.\n\nBy quietness and by humility\nThe great land then puts down the small\nAnd gets it for its own;\nBut small lands too absorb the great\nBy their subservience.\nThus some lie low, designing conquest's ends;\nWhile others lowly are, by nature bent\nTo conquer all the rest.\n\nThe great land's foremost need is to increase\nThe number of its folk;\nThe small land needs above all else to find\nIts folk more room to work.\nThat both be served and each attain its goal\nThe great land should attempt humility.\n\n \n\n\n62\nLike the gods of the shrine in the home,\nSo the Way and its mystery waits\nIn the world of material things:\nThe good man's treasure,\nThe bad man's refuge.\n\nFair wordage is ever for sale;\nFair manners are worn like a cloak;\nBut why should there be such waste\nOf the badness in men?\n\nOn the day of the emperor's crowning,\nWhen the three noble dukes are appointed,\nBetter than chaplets of jade\nDrawn by a team of four horses,\nBring the Way as your tribute.\n\nHow used the ancients to honor the Way?\nDidn't they say that the seeker may find it,\nAnd that sinners who find are forgiven?\nSo did they lift up the Way and its Virtue\nAbove everything else in the world.\n\n \n\n\n63\nAct in repose;\nBe at rest when you work;\nRelish unflavored things.\nGreat or small,\nFrequent or rare,\nRequite anger with virtue.\n\nTake hard jobs in hand\nWhile they are easy;\nAnd great affairs too\nWhile they are small.\nThe troubles of the world\nCannot be solved except\nBefore they grow too hard.\nThe business of the world\nCannot be done except\nWhile relatively small.\nThe Wise Man, then, throughout his life\nDoes nothing great and yet achieves\nA greatness of his own.\n\nAgain, a promise lightly made\nInspires little confidence;\nOr often trivial, sure that man\nWill often come to grief.\nChoosing hardship, then, the Wise Man\nNever meets with hardship all his life.\n\n \n\n\n64\nA thing that is still is easy to hold.\nGiven no omen, it is easy to plan.\nSoft things are easy to melt.\nSmall particles scatter easily.\nThe time to take care is before it is done.\nEstablish order before confusion sets in.\nTree trunks around which you can reach with\n\nyour arms were at first only minuscule sprouts.\nA nine-storied terrace began with a clod.\nA thousand-mile journey began with a foot put down.\n\nDoing spoils it, grabbing misses it;\nSo the Wise Man refrains from doing\n\nand doesn't spoil anything;\nHe grabs at nothing so never misses.\n\nPeople are constantly spoiling a project\nwhen it lacks only a step to completion.\nTo avoid making a mess of it,\nbe as careful of the end as you were of the beginning.\nSo the Wise Man wants the unwanted;\nhe sets no high value on anything\nbecause it is hard to get.\nHe studies what others neglect\nand restores to the world what multitudes have passed by.\nHis object is to restore everything to its natural course,\nbut he dares take no steps to that end.\n\n \n\n\n65\nThose ancients who were skilled in the Way\nDid not enlighten people by their rule\nBut had them ever held in ignorance:\nThe more the folk know what is going on\nThe harder it becomes to govern them.\n\nFor public knowledge of the government\nIs such a thief that it will spoil the realm;\nBut when good fortune brings good times to all\nThe land is ruled without publicity.\nTo know the difference between these two\nInvolves a standard to be sought and found.\n\nTo know that standard always, everywhere,\nIs mystic Virtue, justly known as such;\nWhich Virtue is so deep and reaching far,\nIt causes a return, things go back\nTo that prime concord which at first all shared.\n\n \n\n\n66\nHow could the rivers and the seas\nBecome like kings to valleys?\nBecause of skill in lowliness\nThey have become the valley's lords.\n\nSo then to be above the folk,\nYou speak as if you were beneath;\nAnd if you wish to be out front,\nThen act as if you were behind.\n\nThe Wise Man so is up above\nBut is no burden to the folk;\nHis station is ahead of them\nTo see they do not come to harm.\n\nThe world will gladly help along\nThe Wise Man and will bear no grudge.\nSince he contends not for his own\nThe world will not contend with him.\n\n \n\n\n67\nEverywhere, they say the Way, our doctrine,\nIs so very like detested folly;\nBut greatness of its own alone explains\nWhy it should be thus held beyond the pale.\nIf it were only orthodox, long since\nIt would have seemed a small and petty thing!\n\nI have to keep three treasures well secured:\nThe first, compassion; next, frugality;\nAnd third, I say that never would I once\nPresume that I should be the whole world's chief.\n\nGiven compassion, I can take courage;\nGiven frugality, I can abound;\nIf I can be the world's most humble man,\nThen I can be its highest instrument.\n\nBravery today knows no compassion;\nAbundance is, without frugality,\nAnd eminence without humility:\nThis is the death indeed of all our hope.\n\nIn battle, 'tis compassion wins the day;\nDefending, 'tis compassion that is firm:\nCompassion arms the people God would save!\n\n \n\n\n68\nA skillful soldier is not violent;\nAn able fighter does not rage;\nA mighty conqueror does not give battle;\nA great commander is a humble man.\n\nYou may call this pacific virtue;\nOr say that it is mastery of men;\nOr that it is rising to the measure of God,\nOr to the stature of the ancients.\n\n \n\n\n69\nThe strategists have a saying:\n\n"If I cannot be host,\nThen let me be guest.\nBut if I dare not advance\nEven an inch,\nThen let me retire a foot."\nThis is what they call\nA campaign without a march,\nSleeves up but no bare arms,\nShooting but no enemies,\nOr arming without weapons.\nThan helpless enemies, nothing is worse:\nTo them I lose my treasures.\nWhen opposing enemies meet,\nThe compassionate man is the winner!\n\n \n\n\n70\nMy words are easy just to understand:\nTo live by them is very easy too;\nYet it appears that none in all the world\nCan understand or make them come to life.\n\nMy words have ancestors, my works a prince;\nSince none know this, unknown I too remain.\nBut honor comes to me when least I'm known:\nThe Wise Man, with a jewel in his breast,\nGoes clad in garments made of shoddy stuff.\n\n \n\n\n71\nTo know that you are ignorant is best;\nTo know what you do not, is a disease;\nBut if you recognize the malady\nOf mind for what it is, then that is health.\n\nThe Wise Man has indeed a healthy mind;\nHe sees an aberration as it is\nAnd for that reason never will be ill.\n\n \n\n\n72\nIf people do not dread your majesty,\nA greater dread will yet descend on them.\nSee then you do not cramp their dwelling place,\nOr immolate their children or their stock,\nNor anger them by your own angry ways.\n\nIt is the Wise Man's way to know himself,\nAnd never to reveal his inward thoughts;\nHe loves himself but so, is not set up;\nHe chooses this in preference to that.\n\n \n\n\n73\nA brave man who dares to, will kill;\nA brave man who dares not, spares life;\nAnd from them both come good and ill;\n"God hates some folks, but who knows why?"\nThe Wise Man hesitates there too:\nGod's Way is bound to conquer all\nBut not by strife does it proceed.\n\nNot by words does God get answers:\nHe calls them not and all things come.\nMaster plans unfold but slowly,\nLike God's wide net enclosing all:\nIts mesh is coarse but none are lost.\n\n \n\n\n74\nThe people do not fear at all to die;\nWhat's gained therefore by threatening them with death?\nIf you could always make them fear decease,\nAs if it were a strange event and rare,\nWho then would dare to take and slaughter them?\nThe executioner is always set\nTo slay, but those who substitute for him\nAre like would-be master carpenters\nWho try to chop as that skilled craftsman does\nAnd nearly always mangle their own hands!\n\n \n\n75\nThe people starve because of those\nAbove them, who consume by tax\nIn grain and kind more than their right.\nFor this, the people are in want.\n\nThe people are so hard to rule\nBecause of those who are above them,\nWhose interference makes distress.\nFor this, they are so hard to rule.\n\nThe people do not fear to die;\nThey too demand to live secure:\nFor this, they do not fear to die.\nSo they, without the means to live,\nIn virtue rise above those men\nWho value life above its worth.\n\n \n\n\n76\nAlive, a man is supple, soft;\nIn death, unbending, rigorous.\nAll creatures, grass and trees, alive\nAre plastic but are pliat too,\nAnd dead, are friable and dry.\n\nUnbending rigor is the mate of death,\nAnd wielding softness, company of life:\nUnbending soldiers get no victories;\nThe stiffest tree is readiest for the ax.\nThe strong and mighty topple from their place;\nThe soft and yielding rise above them all.\n\n \n\n\n77\nIs not God's Way much like a bow well bent?\nThe upper part has been disturbed, pressed down;\nThe lower part is raised up from its place;\nThe slack is taken up; the slender width\nIs broader drawn; for thus the Way of God\nCuts people down when they have had too much,\nAnd fills the bowls of those who are in want.\nBut not the way of man will work like this:\nThe people who have not enough are spoiled\nFor tribute to the rich and surfeited.\n\nWho can benefit the world\nFrom stored abundance of his own?\nHe alone who has the Way,\nThe Wise Man who can act apart\nAnd not depend on others' whims;\nBut not because of his high rank\nWill he succeed; he does not wish\nTo flaunt superiority.\n\n \n\n\n78\nNothing is weaker than water,\nBut when it attacks something hard\nOr resistant, then nothing withstands it,\nAnd nothing will alter its way.\n\nEveryone knows this, that weakness prevails\nOver strength and that gentleness conquers\nThe adamant hindrance of men, but that\nNobody demonstrates how it is so.\n\nBecause of this the Wise Man says\nThat only one who bears the nations shame\nIs fit to be its hallowed lord;\nThat only one who takes upon himself\nThe evils of the world may be its king.\n\nThis is paradox.\n\n \n\n\n79\nHow can you think it is good\nTo settle a grievance too great\nTo ignore, when the settlement\nSurely evokes other piques?\n\nThe Wise Man therefore will select\nThe left-hand part of contract tallies:\nHe will not put the debt on other men.\nThis virtuous man promotes agreement;\nThe vicious man allots the blame.\n\n"Impartial though the Way of God may be,\nIt always favors good men."\n\n \n\n\n80\nThe ideal land is small\nIts people very few,\nWhere tools abound\nTen times or yet\nA hundred-fold\nBeyond their use;\nWhere people die\nAnd die again\nBut never emigrate;\nHave boats and carts\nWhich no one rides.\nWeapons have they\nAnd armor too,\nBut none displayed.\nThe folk returns\nTo use again\nThe knotted chords.\nTheir meat is sweet;\nTheir clothes adorned,\nTheir homes at peace,\nTheir customs charm.\n\nAnd neighbor lands\nAre juxtaposed\nSo each may hear\nThe barking dogs,\nThe crowing cocks\nAcross the way;\nWhere folks grow old\nAnd folks will die\nAnd never once\nExchange a call.\n\n \n\n\n81\nAs honest words may not sound fine,\nFine words may not be honest ones;\nA good man does not argue, and\nAn arguer may not be good!\nThe knowers are not learned men\nAnd learned men may never know.\n\nThe Wise Man does not hoard his things;\nHard-pressed, from serving other men,\nHe has enough and some to spare;\nBut having given all he had,\nHe then is very rich indeed.\n\nGod's Way is gain that works no harm;\nThe Wise Man's way, to do his work\nWithout contending for a crown.\n\n
