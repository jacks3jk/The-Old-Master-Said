4	4	Tao is empty (like a bowl). It may be used but its capacity is never exhausted It is bottomless, perhaps the ancestor of all things. It blunts its sharpness. It unties its tangles. It softens its light. It becomes one with the dusty world. Deep and still, it appears to exist forever. I do not know whose son it is. It seems to have existed before the Lord.
