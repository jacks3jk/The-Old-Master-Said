5	3	Exalt not the worthy, so that the people will not fight. Prize not the rare treasure, so that they will not steal. Exhibit not the desirable, so that their hearts will not be distracted. Therefore in governing, the Sage empties the people's hearts and fills their stomachs, weakens their will and strengthens their bones. He always keeps them void of knowledge and desire, so that those who know will not dare to act. Acting through inaction, he leaves nothing ungoverned.
