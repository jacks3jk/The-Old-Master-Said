If no special value is placed upon rare things, one will have no incentive for stealing them. If nothing appears to arouse envy, one will remain satisfied with things as they are Since this is so, the wise administrator does not lead people to set their hearts upon what they cannot have, but satisfies their inner needs. He does not promote ambition to improve their status, but supports their self-sufficiency. He does not complicate their lives with knowledge of multifarious details or with an urge to attend to this, that and the other. By keeping people contented, he prevents those who mistakenly believe that ambition is better than contentment from leading the contented astray. By being calm and contented himself, he sets an example for his people.
