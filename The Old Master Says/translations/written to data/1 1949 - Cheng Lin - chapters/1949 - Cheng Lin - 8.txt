1	8	The way of a good man is like that of water which benefits all things without contention. He is content to keep that which is discarded by the multitude. Hence he is close to Truth. He adapts himself to any environment; he attunes his mind to what is profound; he associates himself with the virtuous; his words inspire confidence; his rule brings about order; he administers affairs with ability; his actions are opportune. Because he does not contend, he gives no cause for resentment.
