6	1 The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name. The nameless is the beginning of heaven and Earth.\nThe named is the mother of the ten thousand things. Ever desireless, one can see the mystery.\nEver desiring, one sees the manifestations. These two spring from the same source but differ in name; this appears as darkness. Darkness within darkness. The gate to all mystery.
