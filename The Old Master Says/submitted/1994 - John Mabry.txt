8	\n1\n\nThe Tao that can be described in words is not the true Tao\nThe Name that can be named is not the true Name.\nFrom non-existence were called Heaven and Earth\nFrom existence All things were born.\nIn being without desires, you experience the wonder\nBut by having desires, you experience the journey.\nYet both spring from the same source and differ mostly in name.\nThis source is called "Mystery"\nMystery upon Mystery,\nThe womb giving birth to All of being.\n\nup\n\n2\n\nWhen people see beauty as beautiful,\nThey recognize other things as ugly.\nWhen people see goodness as good,\nThey recognize other things as being bad.\nTherefore existence and non-existence produce one another\nDifficult and easy achieve each other\nLong and short define each other\nHigh and low rely on each other\nVoice and accompaniment harmonize with one another\nFront and back follow each other.\nTherefore, the Sage acts without "doing"\nAnd teaches without words.\nAll things arise and she does not refuse them.\nShe creates, but does not possess\nAccomplishes, but takes no credit\nWhen finished, she doesn't dwel on it.\nBecause she does not dwel on it, it is always present.\n\nup\n\n3\n\nDo not exalt people who are extraordinarily talented\nOr the people will become competitive.\nDo not value precious goods\nOr the people will become thieves.\nDo not make a public display of riches and finery\nOr the people's hearts will be envious and discontent.\nTherefore, the wise leader will empty their hearts of coveting\nand fil their bellies with sustainance.He discourages their ambition\nand strengthens their bones.\nIf the people are simple and free from desire,\nthe crafty will not dare to take advantage of them.\nBy practicing "not doing," nothing will remain undone.\n\nup\n\n4\n\nThe Tao is like an empty pitcher,\nPoured from, but never drained.\nInfinitely deep, it is the source of All things.\nIt blunts the sharp,\nUnties the knotted,\nShades the bright,\nUnites with All Dust.\nDimly seen, yet eternally present,\nI do not know who gave birth to it,\nIt is older than any conception of God. \n\nup\n\n5\n\nHeaven and Earth are impartial,\nThey allow things to die.\nThe Sage is not sentimental,\nShe knows that All beings must pass away.\nThe space between Heaven and Earth is like a bellows\nEmpty, yet inexhaustible\nThe more it is used, the more it produces.\nTrying to explain, it will only exhaust you.\nIt is better to hold on to ambiguity.\n\nup\n\n6\n\nThe spirit of emptiness is eternal.\nIt is called "the Mysterious Woman."\nHer womb is called "the Source of Heaven and Earth."\nDimly seen, yet eternally present\nIt is always there for you to use. It's easy! \n\nup\n\n7\n\nHeaven is eternal, and Earth is long-lasting.\nWhy are they so enduring?\nBecause they do not live for themselves.\nTherefore the Sage puts himself last\nAnd finds himself in the foremost place.\nHe does not promote himself, thus he is preserved.\nBecause he has no thought of "self,"\nHe is perfectly fulfilled.\n\nup\n\n8\n\nThe sagely person is like water\nWater benefits All things and does not compete with them.\nIt gathers in unpopular places.\nIn this it is like the Tao.\nIn dwelling, live close to the Earth.\nIn thinking, be open to new ideas.\nIn relationships, be kind.\nIn speech, tel the truth and keep your word.\nIn leading people, demonstrate integrity.\nIn daily matters, be competent.\nIn acting, consider the appropriate timing.\nIf you do not try to prove yourself superior to others,\nYou will be beyond reproach. \n\nup\n\n9\n\nFilling your cup until it overflows\nIs not as good as stopping in time.\nOversharpen your sword\nand it will not protect you very long.\nYou may fil your halls with gold and jewels\nBut you cannot keep them safe.\nBeing rich, highly esteemed and proud\nwill only bring you trouble.\nWhen you have done a good job, rest.This is the Way of Heaven.\n\nup\n\n10\n\nBeing both body and spirit,\ncan you embrace unity and not be fragmented?\nBeing spiritually focused,\ncan you become soft, like a newborn baby?\nBeing clear in mind and vision,\ncan you eliminate your flaws?\nLoving All people and leading them well,\ncan you do this without imposing your will?\nWhen Heaven gives and takes away,\ncan you be content to just let things come or go?\nAnd even when you understand All things,\ncan you simply allow yourself to be?\nTo give birth and nourish,\nTo make and not own,\nTo act but not expect something in return,\nTo grow, yet not demand this of others,\nThis is the virtue of Mystery. \n\nup\n\n11\n\nThirty spokes join together at one hub,\nBut it is the hole in the center that makes it operable.\nClay is molded into a pot,\nBut it is the emptiness inside that makes it useful.\nDoors and windows are cut to make a room,\nIt is the empty spaces that we use.\nTherefore, existence is what we have,\nBut non-existence is what we use.\n\nup\n\n12\n\nToo many colors tax people's vision.\nToo many sounds deaden people's hearing.\nToo many flavors spoi people's taste.\nThrill-seeking leads people to do crazy things.\nThe pursuit of wealth just gets in people's way.\nTherefore, the Sage provides for her needs,\nnot her desires.\nShe renounces the latter, and chooses the former.\n\nup\n\n13\n\nSuccess is often as unsettling as failure.\nThe world's troubles are no more important\nThan the well-being of your own body.\nWhy do I say, "Success is often as unsettling as failure?"\nSuccess strikes us deep.\nIt shakes us up to get it.\nIt shakes us up to lose it.\nThus, success is really little different than failure,\nFor both are unsettling.\nWhy do I say, "The World's greatest troubles are no more important\nthan the well-being of your own body?"\nThe reason I think I have troubles\nIs because I have materia existence.\nIf I had no body, what troubles could I possibly have?\nWhat we must do is see the whole world as our "Self."\nOnly then will we be worthy\nOf being entrusted with the World.\nOnly One who values the World as his own body\ncan truly rely on the World in return.\n\nup\n\n14\n\nLook for it and it cannot be seen--it is beyond sight.\nListen for it and it cannot be heard--it is beyond hearing.\nGrasp at it and it cannot be caught--it is beyond substance.\nThese three cannot be fully comprehended.\nThey are fundamentally connected and somehow they are one.\nIts highest isn't bright.\nIts lowest isn't dark.\nIt is infinite! Continually emerging, completely beyond description,\nIt returns again and again to nothingness.\nAnd this is what nothingness looks like:\nIt is the image of the absence of being.\n(It sounds vague and elusive to me!)\nApproach it and you wi not see its beginning\nFollow it and you will not see its end.\nIf you cling to the Tao of ancient times\nThe present will be no problem.\nTo know the ancient origin is to follow the Tao. \n\nup\n\n15\n\nThe Sages of old were scholars who knew well\nThe way of subtlety, mystery and discernment.\nTheir wisdom was beyond comprehension.\nBecause they were beyond comprehension,\nI can only describe their appearance:\nThey were cautious, as if crossing a river in winter.\nThey were hesitant,\nas if fearing danger from All sides, They were polite, as if they were\nguests.\nThey were always growing,\nlike the puddle from a melting cube of ice.\nThey were genuine, like an uncarved block of wood.\nThey were as open-minded as a valley.\nThey were open to infinite possibilities, like a turbulent storm.\nWho can wait for the storm to stop,\nTo find peace in the calm that follows?\nThe person who is able to wait patiently in this peace\nwill eventually know what is right.\nThose who respect the Tao do not go to extremes.\nNot going to extremes, they are inconspicuous and content. \n\nup\n\n16\n\nIf you can empty yourself of everything,\nYou will have lasting peace.\nThings arise, but I contemplate their return.\nThings flourish and grow, and then return to their Source.\nTo return to the Source is to know perfect peace.\nI call this a return to Life.\nReturning to Life is a Universa Constant. Knowing this is illuminating.\nSomeone who doesn't understand this is in error\nand may act dangerously.\nBut knowing this Constant, you can embrace All things.\nEmbracing All things, you can treat them fairly. Treating them fairly,\nyou are noble.\nBeing noble, you are like the cosmos.\nIf you are like the cosmos, you are like the Tao.\nIf you are like the Tao, you will have eterna life,\nand you needn't be afraid of dying.\n\nup\n\n17\n\nThe best leader is one that the people are barely aware of.\nThe next best is one who is loved and praised by the people.\nNext comes one who is feared.\nWorst is one who is despised.\nIf the leader does not have enough faith in the people,\nThey will not have faith in him.\nThe best leader puts great value in words and says little\nSo that when his work is finished\nThe people All say, "We did it ourselves!" \n\nup\n\n18\n\nWhen the great Tao is abandoned,\nIdeas of "humanitarianism" and "righteousness" appear.\nWhen intellectualism arises\nIt is accompanied by great hypocrisy.\nWhen there is strife within a family\nIdeas of "brotherly love" appear.\nWhen a nation is plunged into chaos\nPoliticians become "patriotic." \n\nup\n\n19\n\nForget "holiness," abandon "intelligence"\nand people will be a hundred times better off.\nGive up "humanitarianism," put away "righteousness"\nand people will rediscover brotherly love and kindness.\nForget "great art," throw away "profit"\nand there will be no more thieves.\nThese things are superficia and are simply not enough.\nPeople need something solid to hold on to.\nAnd here it is:\nBe real.\nEmbrace simplicity.\nPut others first.\nDesire little.\n\nup\n\n20\n\nForget ambitious acquisition of knowledge,\nand your sorrows will end.\nHow much difference is there between "yes" and "no"?\nWhat is the distinction between "good" and "evil"?\nMust I value what others value? Nonsense!\nHaving no end to their desires, they are desolate.\nPeople rush here and there, maybe going to a feast,\nOr perhaps climbing a tower in the springtime.\nI alone am calm and unconcerned.\nLike an unselfconscious infant\nAt peace and having no destination.\nMost people have more than they need.\nBut I alone seem lost and out of place.\nI have the mind of a fool--so confused!\nOrdinary people are bright.\nI alone seem dim.\nOrdinary people are discriminating.\nI alone am ambivalent.\nAs quiet as the ocean.\nAs free as the wind.\nPeople rush about on their very important business.\nBut I alone seem incorrigible and uncouth.\nI am different from ordinary people;\nI enjoy feeding from the Great Mother's breasts. \n\nup\n\n21\n\nThe only virtue worth having is that of following the Tao,\nand the only thing you can say about the Tao,\nIs that it is elusive and evasive.\nIt is elusive and evasive, yet it can be observed.\nIt is evasive and elusive, yet it does manifest itself.\nIt is dim and dark, yet its essence can be grasped.\nIts essence is unquestionably genuine. You can put your faith in it.\nFrom the beginning of time until the present,\nIts Name has remained.\nIn it one can see All of Creation.\nHow do I know where All of Creation comes from?\nI know the Tao!\n\nup\n\n22\n\nIf you don"t want to be broken, bend.\nIf you want to be straight, allow some crookedness.\nIf you want to be filled, become empty.\nIf you want to be made new, let yourself be used.\nIf you want to be rich, desire little. Wanting more and more is craziness!\nTherefore the sage embraces oneness\nand becomes a mode for the world.\nNot self-centered, she is enlightened.\nNot self-righteous, she is a shining example.\nNot self-glorifying, she accomplishes glorious things.\nNot boastful, she grows large inside.\nShe alone does not compete,\nAnd so the world can never overcome her.\nWhen the ancients said, "If you don't want to be broken, bend"\nWere they just uttering empty words?\nBend sincerely and wholeness will return to you.\n\nup\n\n23\n\nNature uses few words.\nSo, a whirlwind will not last All morning.\nA sudden storm will not last All day.\nWhat causes these?\nHeaven and Earth.\nIf Heaven and Earth need not speak for long,\nHow much less should humankind?\nTherefore, one who seeks the Tao is at one with the Tao.\nOne who seeks goodness is good.\nOne who seeks loss is lost.\nIf you are one with the Tao, the Tao eagerly accepts you.\nIf you are one with goodness, goodness is happy to receive you.\nIf you are one with loss, loss welcomes you.\nIf you do not trust enough, you will not find trust.\n\nup\n\n24\n\nOne who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm.\nOne who rushes ahead is likely to trip.\nOne who listens only to himself cannot learn.\nOne who considers himself righteous, isn't.\nOne who brags, has nothing to brag about.\nOne who feels sorry for himself does not grow.\nCompared to the Tao, these people are table scraps and wasted effort,\nand not well-liked by anyone or anything.\nSo, if you follow the Tao, you will not live like that.\n\nup\n\n25\n\nBefore Heaven and Earth were born\nThere was something undescribable.\nPerfectly still, having no form,\nIt stands alone, and does not change.\nIt acts perpetually, yet never tires.\nIt could very well be the Mother of the Universe.\nI don't know its name, so I just call it the Tao.\nIf forced to give it a name, I would call it Great.\nBeing Great, I call it eternal.\nBeing eternal, I call it infinite.\nBeing infinite, I call it Reconciliation.\nTherefore, the Tao is Great.\nHeaven is Great.\nThe Earth is Great.\nHumankind is also Great.\nIn the Universe there are these four things which are Great,\nAnd Humankind is one of them.\nHumankind follows the Earth,\nThe Earth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Tao,\nAnd the Tao just acts like itself.\n\nup\n\n26\n\nHeaviness is the root of lightness.\nStillness is the master of restlessness.\nTherefore, the Sage walks All day\nand never parts from the baggage wagon.\nAlthough there are many beautifu palaces to behold,\nHe is beyond such things and is at peace. Why should the ruler of 10,000\nchariots\nAct with such frivolity in this world?\nTo act lightly is to lose one's root.\nTo be restless is to lose one's self control.\n\nup\n\n27\n\nA skillful walker leaves no tracks.\nA skillful speaker makes no mistakes.\nA skillful accountant needs no counting-devices.\nA well-made door needs no lock, yet cannot be opened.\nA well-made binding uses no rope, yet will not be undone.\nTherefore, the Sage is always there to help people\nSo that no one is forsaken.\nShe is always there to see to things\nSo that nothing is lost.\nThis is called being clothed in light.\nWhat is a good person but a bad person's teacher?\nWhat is a bad person but raw materia for a good person?\nIf you do not respect your Teacher,\nOr love your "raw material,"\nYou are greatly confused, regardless of your intelligence.\nI call this an essential, yet subtle mystery.\n\nup\n\n28\n\nKnow the active, the masculine\nYet keep to the passive, the feminine\nAnd you will cradle the World.\nIf you lovingly hold the World\nYou will know eterna goodness\nAnd will become again as a little child.\nBe aware of the obvious-the light\nBut keep to the mysterious-the dark\nAnd set an example for the world.\nBe an example for the world\nAnd do not stray from your calling\nAnd you will return to the Eternal.\nKnow honor\nYet remain humble\nAnd be empty of the world.\nBeing empty of the world\nIs good enough\nAnd you will return to the simplicity of the uncarved block.\nIf the block is carved it is trapped\nIn one form and critiqued.\nThe Sage prefers simplicity and so is ahead of them all.\nHe knows better than to divide the whole.\n\nup\n\n29\n\nDo you want to own the World and improve it?\nI don't think you can.\nYou see, the World is sacred.\nIt can't be improved upon.\nIf you try you will ruin it.\nIf you try to own it,\nYou will lose it.\nTherefore, sometimes you must lead and sometimes you must follow.\nSometimes you need to blow hard, and sometimes you can breathe easily.\nSometimes you must be strong and sometimes tender.\nSometimes you win and sometimes you lose.\nKnowing this, the Sage avoids extremes, extravagances and exhaustion.\n\nup\n\n30\n\nA leader who is advised to rely on the Tao\nDoes not enforce his will upon the world by military means.\nFor such things are likely to rebound.\nWherever armies have camped\nThistles and briars grow.\nIn the wake of war\nBad years are sure to follow.\nA good leader accomplishes only what he has set out to do\nAnd is careful not to overestimate his ability.\nHe achieves his goal, but does not brag.\nHe effects his purpose, but does not show off.\nHe is resolute, but not arrogant.\nHe does what he must, though he may have little choice.\nHe gets results, but not by force.\nThings that grow strong, soon grow weak.\nThis is not the Way of the Tao.\nNot following the Tao leads to an early end.\n\nup\n\n31\n\nAll weapons are bad news\nAnd All creatures should detest them.\nSo those who follow the Tao do not keep them.\n(Wise people prefer the left side as the place of honor,\nBut the genera always stands on the right.)\nWeapons are the tools of fear.\nThey are not appropriate for a Sage\nAnd should only be one's last resort.\nPeace is always far superior.\nThere is no beauty in victory.\nTo find beauty in it would be to rejoice at killing people.\nAnyone who delights in slaughter will never find satisfaction in this\nworld.\n(When celebrating happy occasions, the left side is the place of honor,\nBut on unhappy occasions, the right is preferred.\nThen we see those of lower rank standing on the left;\nThe Genera is given the right-hand position.)\nMilitary officers should observe their duties gravely,\nFor when many people are killed\nThey should be mourned with great sorrow.\nCelebrate your victory only with funera rites.\n\nup\n\n32\n\nThe Tao will always be beyond comprehension.\nAlthough it seems trivial\nNo one in All the world can contro it.\nIf governments and leaders can abide in it\nAll beings shal gratefully behave likewise.\nWe would have a Heaven on Earth\nAnd sweet rains would fall.\nThe people would not need to be told, They would just naturally do\nwhat is right.\nWhen you organize, you must of necessity use names and order.\nBut given that, you must also know where to leave off\nnaming and structuring.\nKnowing when to stop, you can avoid danger.\nAll the World is to the Tao\nAs rivers flowing home to the sea.\n\nup\n\n33\n\nOne who knows others is intelligent.\nOne who knows himself is truly wise.\nOne who overcomes others has force.\nOne who overcomes the self has true strength.\nOne who knows he has enough is truly wealthy.\nOne who has discipline is sincere.\nOne who remembers his Source will endure.\nHe embraces death and so does not perish\nbut lives forever.\n\nup\n\n34\n\nThe great Tao flows everywhere, to the left and to the right.\nAll things rely on it for their life\nand it does not refuse them.\nWhen its work is done, it does not demand recognition.\nIt clothes and nourishes All things\nand does not demand allegiance.\nSince it makes no demands for itself, it can seem to be of smal regard.\nYet as All things return to it of their own accord, without being commanded,\nit can truly be regarded Great.\nIt is only because it does not claim to be Great\nThat it is able to achieve such Greatness.\n\nup\n\n35\n\nWhoever holds firmly to following the Tao\nWil draw All the World to herself.\nShe may go anywhere and not be afraid,\nFinding only safety, balance and peace.\nMusic and good food lure passers-by\nBut words about the Tao\nSeem bland and flavorless to them.\nLook, and it cannot be seen.\nListen, and it cannot be heard.\nUse it, and it cannot be exhausted.\n\nup\n\n36\n\nWhat you want shrunk\nMust first be allowed to expand.\nWhat you want weakened\nMust first be strengthened.\nWhat you want destroyed\nMust first be allowed to flourish.\nThat which you want to take\nMust first be given.\nSeeing this is an understanding of the subtle.\nWhat is soft and weak overcomes what is hard and strong.\nJust as a fish should keep to deep waters,\nSo a country's weapons should be kept out of sight, so as not to tempt\npeople.\n\nup\n\n37\n\nThe Tao never "acts"\nYet nothing is left undone.\nIf the governments and leaders would keep it\nAll things would of their own accord be transformed.\nShould desires arise from transformation\nI shal influence them through silent simplicity.\nSilent simplicity involves being free from desires.\nWhen you are without desire you are content\nAnd All the World is at peace.\n\nup\n\n38\n\nA truly good person does not try to be good,\nTherefore is he able to be good.\nAnother person tries to be good,\nAnd finds that he cannot.\nA good person does not act, nor has any reason to.\nAnother person is always doing\nBecause he thinks he has to.\nA humanitarian acts from the heart.\nA politician acts, but he has ulterior motives.\nWhen a legalist acts and gets no response,\nHe rolls up his sleeves and uses force.\nTherefore, when the Tao is lost, Remember that there is stil goodness.\nWhen goodness is lost, there is stil kindness.\nWhen kindness is lost, there is stil the law.\nWhen the law is lost, there is stil politeness.\nPoliteness is the thin edge of loyalty and trust,\nAnd is the beginning of chaos. We need those who try to direct society\nAbout as much as the Tao needs a flower\nTo make it attractive.\nThey mark the beginnings of stupidity.\nThe Sage concerns herself with causes,\nNot symptoms\nAnd focuses on the Tao, not the silly flower.\nForget the flower, follow the Tao instead.\n\nup\n\n39\n\nPeople of ancient times possessed oneness.\nThe sky attained oneness and so became clear.\nEarth attained oneness and so found peace.\nThe Spirit attains oneness and so is replenished.\nThe Valleys attained oneness and so became full.\nAll things attain oneness and they flourish.\nThe ancient leaders attained oneness\nAnd so becme examples for All the world.\nAll of this is achieved by oneness.\nWithout oneness, the sky would crack\nThe Earth explode\nThe Spirit exhaust\nThe valley deplete\nLeaders would certainly fall\nAnd All life, perish.\nTherefore the Great recognizes the Smal as its root.\nThe High takes the Low as its foundation.\nLeaders refer to themselves as orphans and widows.\nIs this not grounding oneself in humility? Therefore the highest renown\nis no renown.\nWe do not want to glitter like jewels.\nWe do not want to be hard as stone.\n\nup\n\n40\n\nReturning is the movement of the Tao.\nYielding is the way of the Tao.\nAll things in the world are born of being.\nBeing is born of non-being.\n\nup\n\n41\n\nWhen wise people hear about the Tao\nThey follow it carefully.\nWhen ordinary people hear about the Tao\nThey can take it or leave it.\nWhen foolish people hear about the Tao\nThey laugh out loud.\nIf they didn't laugh out loud, it wouldn't be the Tao!\nTherefore it is said:\nThe path into light seems dark.\nThe way ahead seems to go backwards.\nThe path into peace seems rough.\nThe greatest good seems to us empty.\nTrue purity seems stained.\nThe best efforts seem inadequate.\nAppropriate caution seems like cowardice.\nTrue essence seems violated.\nThe truly square bears no corners. Sound vessels take time to build.\nCelestia music is seldom paid much heed.\nThe greatest image is impossible to capture. The Tao is hidden and\nnameless\nYet it is the Tao alone that nourishes\nand completes All things.\n\nup\n\n42\n\nThe Tao gives birth to one.\nOne gives birth to two.\nTwo gives birth to three,\nAnd three gives birth to All things.\nAll things carry Yin and embrace Yang\nDesiring nothing and finding harmony.\nAll people hate loneliness and poverty\nThough they are the noblest of states.\nSo in losing, much is gained,\nAnd in gaining, much is lost.\nWhat others have taught, I also teach:\n"The violent shal die with violence."\nThis is my primary teaching.\n\nup\n\n43\n\nThe softest thing in the World\nOvercomes the hardest thing in the World.\nThat which is without substance can enter even where there is no space.\nTherefore I know the value of non-action.\nTeaching without words\nAnd benefit without actions\nThere are few in the World who can grasp it.\n\nup\n\n44\n\nFame or self: which is more important?\nYour possessions or your person: which is worth more to you?\nGain or loss: which is worse?\nTherefore, to be obsessed with "things" is a great waste,\nThe more you gain, the greater your loss.\nBeing content with what you have been given, You can avoid disgrace.\nKnowing when to stop, You will avoid danger.\nThat way you can live a long and happy life.\n\nup\n\n45\n\nTrue perfection seems flawed\nYet its usefulness is never exhausted.\nTrue fulfillment seems empty\nYet its usefulness is infinite.\nTrue straightness seems crooked,\nGreat skil appears easy,\nGreat eloquence sounds awkward.\nCold overcomes heat.\nTranquility conquers agitation.\nPurity and stillness is the universa ideal.\n\nup\n\n46\n\nWhen the World keeps to the Tao\nStrong horses are best used to manufacture manure.\nWhen the World forgets the Tao\nWar horses are bred outside the city.\nThere is no greater curse than discontent.\nNothing breeds trouble like greed.\nOnly one who is content with what is enough\nwill be content always.\nl\n\nup\n\n47\n\nWithout going outside, You can know the whole world.\nWithout looking out the window,\nYou can know Heaven's Way.\nThe further out you seek\nThe less you understand.\nTherefore, the Sage\nKnows without needing to travel,\nUnderstands without needing to see,\nAccomplishes without "doing."\n\nup\n\n48\n\nTo pursue learning is to grow a little more every day.\nTo pursue the Tao is to desire a little less every day.\nDesire less and less\nUnti you arrive at "not-doing."\nWhen you practice "not-doing," nothing is left undone.\n \nIf you want to have the whole world,\nHave nothing.\nIf you are always busy doing something,\nYou cannot enjoy the world.\nl\n\nup\n\n49\n\nThe Sage's heart is not set in stone.\nShe is as sensitive to the people's feelings as to her own.\nShe says, "To people who are good, I am good.\nAnd to people who are not good? I am good to them, too."\nThis is true goodness.\n"People who are trustworthy, I trust.\nAnd people who are not trustworthy, I also trust."\nThis is rea trust.\nThe Sage who leads harmoniously considers the mind of\nher people as well as her own.\nThey look to her anxiously.\nThey are like her own children.\n\nup\n\n50\n\nFrom birth to death,\nThree people out of ten are celebrators of Life.\nThree people out of ten are advocates of Death.\nThe rest simply move numbly from cradle to grave.\nWhy is this?\nBecause they are overly protective of this life.\nIt is said that one who knows how to protect his life can\nwalk freely without fear of the wild buffalo or tiger.\nHe may meet an army bravely with neither sword nor shield.\nFor the buffalo will find no place to sink its horns,\nThe tiger finds no place to dig his claws,\nWeapons find no soft spot to pierce. Why?\nBecause there is no place for death in him.\n\nup\n\n51\n\nThe Tao gives birth to All things.\nNature's goodness nurtures them.\nMatter forms them.\nEnvironment shapes them.\nTherefore, All things cannot help but to respect the Tao and treasure\ngoodness.\nRespect for the Tao and the treasuring of goodness are not demanded\nof them, they do it naturally.\nSo, the Tao gives birth,\nNature's goodness nurtures them.\ngrows them, raises them and enables them to mature,\nripens them, nourishes and shelters them.\nThe Tao gives birth, but does not possess;\nActs, but does not take credit;\nGuides, but does not control.\nThis is the mystery of goodness.\n\nup\n\n52\n\nThe World has an origin\nWhich we may regard as the Mother of the Universe.\nKnowing the Mother, we can also come to know her children.\nKnowing the children, return and hold fast to the Mother.\nDoing this, you will not meet with danger your whole life long.\nclose your mouth Go easy on the senses And life will not be so hard.\nIf you spend your life filling your senses\nAnd rushing around "doing" things\nYou will be beyond hope.\nTo concern yourself with the beautiful and small\nis true wisdom.\nTo foster gentleness is true strength. Choose to do what is wise and\nreturn to wisdom\nThen you will avoid life's troubles.\nThis is called practicing consistency.\n\nup\n\n53\n\nIf I possess even a little wisdom\nThen while I walk in the light of the Tao\nMy only fear is that I'l fal into "doing."\nThe path of the Tao is obvious and simple,\nBut most people prefer to take short-cuts.\nThe courts of law are far from the people's hearts.\nThe fields are ful of weeds, And the storehouses are empty.\nBut look, here are officials in elegant apparel\ncarrying sharp swords\nEating and drinking until they are bloated,\nPossessed of such wealth that they could never use it all.\nI call this positively criminal.\nIt is not the way of the Tao.\n\nup\n\n54\n\nOne who is well grounded will not be uprooted.\nOne who has a firm embrace will not let go.\nHis descendants will faithfully carry on his tradition.\nCultivate these things in yourself\nAnd you will have true goodness.\nCultivate these in your family\nAnd goodness will increase.\nCultivate these in your community\nAnd goodness will catch on.\nCultivate these in your nation\nAnd goodness will overflow!\nCultivate these in the World\nAnd goodness will fil the Universe.\nAnd so, let the self examine the self.\nLet the family consider the family.\nLet the community examine the community.\nLet the nation evaluate the nation.\nLet the World contemplate the World.\nHow do I know the World is like this?\nThrough these:\nGrounding and embracing.\n\nup\n\n55\n\nOne who is filled with goodness is like a freshly-born infant.\nWasps, scorpions and snakes will not bite her.\nWild beasts will not attack her, nor will birds of prey pounce on her.\nHer bones may be fragile and her skin soft,\nBut her grasp is firm.\nShe does not recognize the union of male and female\nFor she knows it only as an undivided whole.\nThis is the essence of perfection.\nShe can how All day and not get hoarse.\nThis is perfect harmony.\nKnowing harmony is faithfulness.\nKnowing faithfulness is salvation.\nTrying to extend one's life-span is dangerous and unnatural.\nTo manipulate one's energy with the mind is a powerfu thing\nBut whoever possesses such strength invariably grows old and withers.\nThis is not the way of the Tao.\nAll those who do not follow the Tao will come to an early end.\n\nup\n\n56\n\nThose who know, do not speak.\nThose who speak, do not know.\nSo shut your mouth\nGuard your senses\nBlunt your sharpness\nUntangle your affairs\nSoften your glare\nBe one with All dust.\nThis is the mystery of union.\nYou cannot approach it Yet you cannot escape it.\nYou cannot benefit it\nYet you cannot harm it.\nYou cannot bestow any honor on it\nYet you cannot rob it of its dignity.\nThat is why the whole Universe reveres it.\n\nup\n\n57\n\nAs a leader, lead properly.\nDon't resort to force in the usua ways.\nWin the World by "not-doing."\nHow do I know to do this?\nListen, the more laws and prohibitions there are\nThe poorer the people become.\nThe more dreadfu weapons you have\nThe more chaotic the state of the nation.\nThe more clever and advanced your knowledge\nThe stranger things become.\nThe more commandments and regulations you have\nThe more thieves there are.\nTherefore the Sage who leads says:\n"I practice "not-doing" and the people transform themselves.\nI enjoy peace and the people correct themselves.\nI stay out of their business affairs and the people prosper.\nI have no desires and the people, All by themselves,\nbecome simple and honest."\n\nup\n\n58\n\nWhen a government is unobtrusive\nThe people are simple and honest.\nWhen a government is suspicious and strict\nThe people are discontented and sneaky.\nBlessings are rooted in misery.\nMisery lurks behind blessing.\nWhere does it ever end?\nThere is no such thing as "normal."\nWhat seems norma is only an illusion,\nAnd what seems good is finally revealed to be monstrous.\nThe people's confusion has lasted a very long time.\nTherefore the Sage is honest, but not judgmental\nStrong, but not injurious to others\nStraightforward, but not reckless\nBright, but not blinding.\n\nup\n\n59\n\nIn leading people and serving Heaven\nThere is nothing better than moderation.\nIn moderation, one is already following the Tao.\nWhen one follows the Tao, great goodness is abundant.\nWhen great goodness is in abundance,\nThere is nothing that cannot be overcome.\nWhen there is nothing that cannot be overcome\nThen there are no limits.\nHaving no limits, one can certainly govern a country.\nIf you know the country's Mother, you will long endure.\nI call this having deep roots and a firm stalk.\nThis is the Way of long life and great insight.\n\nup\n\n60\n\nGovern a big country as you would fry a smal fish.\nApproach the world with the Tao and evi will have no power.\nNot that evi has no power, but it will not harm people.\nNot that evi is not harmful,\nBut the Sage is dedicated to not harming people-even evi people.\nWhen no one hurts another,\nAll will eventually return to the good.\n\nup\n\n61\n\nA great country is like a low-lying lake where many rivers converge;\nA foca point for the Earth, the feminine Spirit of the World.\nThe female always overcomes the male by stillness.\nStillness is the lowest position.\nTherefore a big country, By placing itself below a smaller country\nWil win the smaller country.\nAnd a smal country, By placing itself below a larger country\nWil gain the large country.\nTherefore, by being humble, one gains\nAnd the other, being humble already, also gains.\nA great country needs to embrace the lowly.\nThe smal country needs to serve others.\nThus, both needs are satisfied\nAnd each gets what it wants.\nRemember, the great country should always humble itself.\n\nup\n\n62\n\nThe Tao is the bosom of the Universe\nIt is the good person's treasure\nAnd the bad person's refuge.\nFlattery may buy one's position\nAnd good deeds can win people over\nBut if one's heart is not pure\nThat is All the more reason to cling to the Tao!\nTherefore when a king is coronated,\nCrowned in ceremony,\nPresented with gifts of rare value, And escorted in luxury,\nAll these things pale when compared to the humble gift of the Tao,\noffered in silence.\nWhy did the Sages of old value the Tao so much?\nBecause, when you seek, you find\nAnd when you sin, you are forgiven.\nThat is why the Tao is the greatest treasure of the Universe.\n\nup\n\n63\n\nDo without "doing".\nWork without forcing.\nTaste without seasonings.\nRecognize the Great in the small,\nAnd the many in the few.\nRepay hatred with kindness.\nDea with the difficult while it is stil easy.\nBegin great works while they are small.\nCertainly the Earth does difficult work with ease,\nAnd accomplishes great affairs from smal beginnings.\nSo, the Sage, by not striving for greatness,\nAchieves greatness.\nA person who makes promises lightly\nIs not regarded as trustworthy.\nlIf you think everything is easy,\nYou will find only difficulty.\nThat is why the Sage considers All things difficult\nAnd finds nothing too difficult in the end.\n\nup\n\n64\n\nWhat is at rest is easy to maintain.\nWhat has not yet happened is easy to plan.\nThat which is fragile is easily shattered\nThat which is tiny is easily scattered.\nCorrect problems before they occur.\nIntervene before chaos erupts.\nA tree too big around to hug is produced from a tiny sprout.\nA nine-story tower begins with a mound of dirt.\nA thousand-mile journey begins with your own two feet.\nWhoever tries will fail.\nWhoever clutches, loses.\nTherefore the Sage, not trying, cannot fail\nNot clutching, she cannot lose.\nWhen people try,\nThey usually fail just on the brink of success.\nIf one is as cautious at the outset as at the end,\nOne cannot fail.\nTherefore the Sage desires nothing so much\nas to be desireless.\nShe does not value rare and expensive goods.\nShe unlearns what she was once taught\nAnd helps the people regain what they have lost;\nTo help every being assume its natura way of being,\nAnd not dare to force anything.\n\nup\n\n65\n\nIn ancient times those who followed the Tao\nDid not try to educate the people.\nThey chose to let them be.\nThe reason people become hard to govern\nIs that they think they know it all.\nSo, if a leader tries to lead through cleverness,\nHe is nothing but a liability.\nBut if a leader leads, not through cleverness, but\nthrough goodness, this is a blessing to all.\nTo be always conscious of the Great Pattern\nIs a spiritua virtue.\nSpiritua virtue is awesome and infinite\nAnd it leads All things back to their Source.\nThen there emerges the Great Harmony.\n\nup\n\n66\n\nRivers and the sea are able to rule the streams of a hundred valleys.\nBecause they are good at taking the lower position,\nThe streams of a hundred valleys run to them.\nTherefore, if you want to rule effectively over people\nYou must surely speak as if below them.\nIf you want to lead well,\nYou must surely walk behind them.\nThat way when the Sage takes a position of power\nThe people will not fee oppressed.\nAnd when the Sage leads\nThe people will not think he is in the way.\nTherefore the whole world joyfully praises him\nand does not tire of him.\nBecause he refuses to compete,\nThe world cannot compete with him.\n\nup\n\n67\n\nEveryone says this Tao of mine is great and nebulous.\nSo great, in fact, that it is too nebulous\nTo be of any use.\nI have three treasures that I hold and cherish:\nOne is called "compassion"\nAnother is called "moderation"\nAnd the third is called "daring not to compete."\nWith compassion, one is able to be brave.\nWith moderation, one has enough to be generous with others.\nWithout competition, one is fit to lead.\nNowadays people don't bother with compassion But just try to be brave.\nThey scoff at moderation\nAnd find they have little enough for themselves.\nThey step on people in their rush to be first---\nThis is death!\nOne who is compassionate in warfare is victorious\nAnd in defense he holds fast.\nWhen Heaven moves to save someone\nIt protects him through compassion.\n\nup\n\n68\n\nThe best soldier is not violent.\nThe best fighter is not driven by anger.\nThe true conqueror wins without confrontation.\nThe best employer is humble before his employees.\nI say there is much good in not competing.\nI call it using the power of the people.\nThis is known as being in tune with Heaven, Like the Sages of old.\n\nup\n\n69\n\nThe military has a saying:\n"I would rather be passive, like a guest\nthan aggressive, like a host.\nI would rather retreat a foot\nthan advance an inch."\nThis is called going forward without instigating,\nEngaging without force\nDefense without hatred\nVictory without weapons.\nThere is no greater calamity than underestimating the enemy.\nIf I take my enemy too lightly, I am in danger of losing my\ncompassion, moderation and non-competitive spirit.\nSo, when two armies confront each other\nVictory will go to them that grieve.\n\nup\n\n70\n\nMy words are very easy to understand\nAnd very easy to practice.\nYet the World is not able to understand\nNor able to put them into practice.\nMy words speak of the primal.\nMy deeds are but service.\nUnless people understand this\nThey won't understand me.\nAnd since so few understand me,\nThen such understanding is rare and valuable indeed.\nTherefore the Sage wears common clothes\nAnd hides his treasures only in his heart.\n\nup\n\n71\n\nShe who knows that she does not know is the best off.\nHe who pretends to know but doesn't is ill.\nOnly someone who realizes he is ill can become whole.\nThe sage is not il because she recognizes this illness as illness,\nTherefore she is not ill.\n\nup\n\n72\n\nWhen people lose their fear of power\nThen great power has indeed arrived.\nDo not intrude on the people's materia living.\nDo not despise their spiritua lives, either.\nIf you respect them, you will be respected.\nTherefore the Sage knows himself,\nBut he is not opinionated.\nHe loves himself, but he is not arrogant.\nHe lets go of conceit and opinion, and embraces self-knowledge and\nlove.\n\nup\n\n73\n\nA soldier who has the courage to fight will eventually be killed.\nBut one who has the courage not to fight will live.\nIn these two, one is good and the other harmful.\nWho knows why Heaven allows some things to happen?\nEven the Sage is stumped sometimes.\nThe Way of Heaven Does not compete, but is good at winning;\nDoes not speak, yet always responds;\nDoes not demand, but is usually obeyed;\nSeems chaotic, but unfolds a most excellent plan.\nHeaven's net is cast wide\nAnd though its meshes are loose,\nNothing is ever lost.\n\nup\n\n74\n\nIf people do not fear death\nHow can you threaten them with it?\nIf people live in constant fear of death,\nBecause those who break the law are seized and killed,\nWho would dare to break the law?\nThere has always been an officia executioner.\nIf you take the law into your own hands\nAnd try to take his place, It is like trying to take the place of a\nmaster carpenter\nIn which case you would probably hurt your hands.\n\nup\n\n75\n\nThe people are starving because their leaders eat up\nAll their money in taxes.\nAnd so, they are hungry.\nThe people are rebellious\nBecause their leaders are intrusive.\nAnd so, they protest.\nThe people make light of death because their leaders\nlive so well at their expense.\nAnd so, they expect death.\nTherefore, it seems that one who does not grasp this life\ntoo tightly is better off than one who clings.\n\nup\n\n76\n\nWhen people are alive they are soft and weak.\nAt their death they are hard and rigid.\nAll young things, including grass and trees\nAre soft and frail.\nAt their death they are withered and dry.\nSo, All that are hard and rigid take the company of death.\nThose who are soft and weak take the company of life.\nTherefore, powerfu weapons will not succeed\n(Remember that strong and tal trees\nare the ones that are cut down).\nThe strong and rigid are broken and laid low.\nThe soft and weak will always overcome.\n\nup\n\n77\n\nThe Tao of Heaven is like the stringing of a bow.\nThe high is pressed down and the low is raised up.\nThe string that is too long is shortened\nand the string that is too short is added to.\nHeaven's Way is to take from what has too much\nAnd give it to what does not have enough.\nThis is not the way of men, however,\nFor they take from those who have little\nTo increase the wealth of the rich.\nSo who is it that has too much\nand offers it to a needy World?\nOnly someone who knows the Tao.\nTherefore, the Sage works anonymously.\nShe achieves great things\nBut does not wait around for praise.\nShe does not want her talents to attract attention to her.\n\nup\n\n78\n\nIn the whole World nothing is softer or weaker than water.\nAnd yet even those who succeed when attacking the hard and the strong\ncannot overcome it\nBecause nothing can harm it.\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\nThe soft conquers the hard.\nNo one in the World can deny this\nYet no one seems to know how to put it into practice.\nTherefore the Sage says\n"One who accepts a peoples" shame is qualified to rule it.\nOne who embraces a condemned people.\nis called the king of the Universe."\nTrue words seem paradoxical.\n\nup\n\n79\n\nWhen enemies are reconciled, some resentment invariably remains.\nHow can this be healed?\nTherefore the Sage makes good on his half of the deal\nAnd demands nothing of others.\nOne who is truly good will keep his promise.\nOne who is not good will take what he can.\nHeaven doesn't choose sides\nIt is always with the good people.\n\nup\n\n80\n\nIt is best to have smal communities with few people.\nAnd although they have goods and equipment in abundance\nfew of them are even used.\nThey have great love of life,\nand are content to be right where they are.\nAnd although they have boats and carriages,\nThere is no place they particularly want to go.\nAnd although they have access to weapons and machineries\nof war, they have no desire to show them off.\nLet people return to simplicity, working with their own hands.\nThen they will find joy in their food\nBeauty in their simple clothes\nPeace in their living\nFulfillment in their traditions.\nAnd although they live within sight of neighboring states\nAnd their roosters and dogs are heard by one another\nThe people are content to grow old and die\nWithout having gone to see their neighbor states.\n\nup\n\n81\n\nTrue words are not beautifull.\nBeautifu words are not true.\nGood people do not argue.\nArgumentative people are not good.\nThe wise are not necessarily well-educated.\nThe well-educated are not necessarily wise.\nThe Sage does not hoard things.\nThe more she does for others\nThe more she finds she has.\nThe more she gives to others\nThe more she finds she gains.\nHeaven's Way is to nourish, not to harm.\nThe Sage's Way is to work, yet not compete.\n\n
