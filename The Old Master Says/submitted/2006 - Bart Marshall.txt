thousand things.\n\nWhen desire is absent, the mystery is obvious.\nWhen desire occurs, creation unfolds.\n\nMystery and creation arise from the same source.\nThe source is emptiness.\nVoid within void.\nThe realm of Tao.\n\n \n\nup\n\n2\n\nJudging beauty creates ugliness.\nDefining good creates evil.\nAll and void arise together.\n\nHard and soft,\nlong and short,\nhigh and low,\nsound and silence,\nnow and then.\nOpposites exist because of each other.\n\nTherefore the sage acts by not-doing and teaches no-thought.\nThe ten thousand things arise and vanish without him.\n\nHe works without motive,\nindifferent to outcome.\nBecause there is no doer,\nhis actions are timeless.\n\n \n\nup\n\n3\n\nBestowing honor breeds ambitions.\nHoarding treasure invites thieves.\nDisplaying objects of desire sows the seeds of discontent.\n\nTherefore the sage governs\nby emptying minds and filling bellies,\nby weakening wills and strengthening bones.\n\nHe extols the virtue of desireless unknowing\nand keeps intellects off balance.\n\nWhen not-doing is accomplished,\nnothing remains undone.\n\n \n\nup\n\n4\n\nTao is hollow emptiness.\n\nThe substance of All,\nit is absent of substance.\nDimensionless Void,\nit is the source of the ten thousand things.\n\nIt blunts sharpness,\nunravels entanglements,\ndiffuses brightness,\nmerges with dust.\n\nDark, invisible, it only seems to be.\nIt is the child of no-thing\nand the father of God.\n\n \n\nup\n\n5\n\nThe realm of heaven and earth is indifferent to the myriad creatures.\nThey appear as straw dogs.\nThe sage is indifferent to the multitudes of men.\nThey appear as straw dogs.\n\nThe realm of heaven and earth is like a bellows,\nboth empty and full.\nMoving, it brings forth, endlessly.\n\nMore words, less understanding.\nHold fast to the core.\n\nup\n\n6\n\nThe urge of creation is ceaseless.\nIt is called the Dark Mother.\n\nThe womb of the Dark Mother\nis the ground of heaven and earth.\n\nTimeless, imperceptible,\nit continues ever-present.\n\nEndless use does not touch it.\n\nup\n\n7\n\nThe realm of heaven and earth is everlasting.\n\nWhy is it everlasting?\nBecause it is not conscious of itself.\nHaving no thought of being, it never is not.\n\nLike this, the sage forgets himself\nso is always present.\n\nWithout self-concern,\nthe self is eternal.\nWhen self-interest subsides,\nfulfillment happens.\n\nup\n\n8\n\nSupreme virtue is like water.\nIt nourishes the ten thousand things without effort\nand flows in places men shun.\nIt is like Tao.\n\nStand on solid ground.\nGo deep into the heart.\nSpeak only what is true.\n\nIn friendship, be kind.\nIn governing, be just.\nIn enterprise, be able.\nIn action, watch the timing.\n\nDo not contend with nature and nothing will go wrong.\n\nup\n\n9\n\nAn over-filled cup is difficult to carry.\nAn over-sharp point is easily broken.\n\nFill your house with gold and jade\nand it cannot be protected.\nBecome puffed with pride\nand disaster will follow.\n\nDo only what needs doing then forget it.\nThis is the way of heaven.\n\nup\n\n10\n\nWhile maintaining a body\ncan you become One?\nWhile breathing the force of life\ncan you be innocent as a babe?\nWhile polishing the dark mirror\ncan you be without dust?\n\nWhile loving and ruling the people\ncan you refrain from action?\nWhile coming and going from heaven\ncan you be passive as a woman?\nUnderstanding all things\ncan you abide in unknowing?\n\nGive birth and nurture.\nCreate without claim.\nLead without taking command.\n\nThis is supreme

palette.\n\nRacing and hunting madden the mind.\nValuable goods hinder movement.\n\nTherefore the sage is guided by his gut, not his senses.\nHe attends to one and ignores the other.\n\nup\n\n13\n\nReceive honor with dismay.\nAccept misfortune gratefully.\n\nWhy receive honor with dismay?\nHonor and dishonor cause the same disturbance.\nWith honor comes the fear of disgrace.\nWith disgrace comes anxiety and dread.\n\nWhy accept misfortune gratefully?\nMisfortune weakens the bond to body and self.\nWithout a separate self, what misfortune is possible?\nSee misfortune as a condition of separation,\nand you will become whole.\n\nSee the world as your body, and all will be delivered unto you.\n\nup\n\n14\n\nSearching, we cannot see it.\nWe call it ephemeral.\nStraining, we cannot hear it.\nWe call it ethereal.\nReaching, we cannot grasp it.\nWe call it intangible.\n\nThese three are often confused\nbecause they are the same.\n\nThe One is not bright above and dark below.\nTransparent, it moves in and out of nothing.\n\nIts form has no shape.\nIts image has no substance.\nIt is indistinct, elusive.\nNothing to face, nothing to follow.\n\nHold to the timeless Tao.\nAbide in the present.\nNow is the ancient beginning.\n\nup\n\n15\n\nThe old masters were deep, unfathomable,\nprofound beyond understanding.\nBecause they were unfathomable\nwe can only describe their demeanor.\n\nCautious, as if crossing an icy stream.\nAlert, as if sensing danger.\nRespectful, like visiting guests.\nYielding, like melting ice.\nSimple, like uncarved wood.\nOpen, like beckoning valleys.\nMysterious, like opaque pools.\n\nStill the mind and the mud settles.\nDo nothing and action comes of itself.\n\nOne who embraces Tao has no desire for fulfillment.\nNot desiring fulfillment, he is finished with birth and death.\n\nup\n\n16\n\nBe completely empty.\nBe completely still.\n\nWitness the ten thousand things\nappear and vanish in one motion.\nWatch as they arise, linger,\nand return to the source—stillness.\n\nThis is the way it is.\nIt is called everlasting life.\nTo witness the everlasting is to be awake.\n\nNot seeing the everlasting, one engages in blind action.\nBlind action leads to misfortune.\n\nSeeing the everlasting, one encompasses all.\nEncompassing all, one is impartial.\nBeing impartial, one acts nobly.\nActing nobly, one enters heaven.\n\nEntering heaven is to be one with Tao.\nBeing one with Tao is to be everlasting.\n\nThough the body dies, nothing is disturbed.\n\nup\n\n17\n\nWhen a sage governs, people barely notice.\n\nLesser rulers are praised and loved.\nLesser still are feared and obeyed.\nThe least are ridiculed and despised.\nTrust is earned by trusting.\n\nThe sage uses words sparingly.\nHis work is done without fanfare.\nPeople say: “It happened by itself.”\n\nup\n\n18\n\nWhen Tao is forgotten,\ncharity and righteousness are born.\n\nWhen intelligence and knowledge are

alone am unmoved, like an infant too young to smile.\n\nOthers have more than enough.\nI alone have nothing.\nMy mind is that of a fool—empty.\n\nOthers are clear and bright.\nI alone am nebulous and dim.\nOthers are alert and clever.\nI alone am withdrawn,\nadrift in the ocean,\ndirectionless as swirling wind.\n\nEveryone else has purpose.\nI alone am stubborn and untamed.\nI am different.\nI am nourished by the Dark Mother.\n\nup\n\n21\n\nSupreme virtue is to abide in Tao alone.\n\nTao is elusive and empty—\noh yes, utterly empty and elusive—\nyet within it dreamlike images arise.\n\nOh yes, it is indistinct and nebulous,\nbut within it shadows take form.\n\nOh yes, it is mysterious and dark,\nbut within it appearances originate.\n\nThe origin of creation is the real.\nIts manifestations are unceasing.\nThis can be witnessed.\n\nHow do I witness the origin of creation?\nBy looking!\n\n \n\nup\n\n22\n\nSurrender and become whole.\nBend low and be straightened.\nBecome empty and be filled.\nBurn out and be renewed.\n\nHaving nothing, beauty is revealed.\nHaving much, the way is hidden.\n\nThe sage abides in One\nand thus is master of heaven and earth.\nNot being self-absorbed, his vision is clear.\nNot asserting himself, his light shines forth.\nNot showing off, his merit is obvious.\nNot praising himself, praise is showered upon him.\nNot contending, nothing under heaven stands in his way.\n\nThis ancient saying, “Surrender and become whole,”\nis it empty words?\nBeing whole means all things have returned to you.\n\nup\n\n23\n\nTo speak a short time is the way of nature.\nHigh winds blow out before morning.\nHard rain subsides in a day.\n\nWhat issues these?\nThe realm of heaven and earth.\nIf the realm of heaven and earth cannot maintain duration,\nwhat chance has man?\nThis is why one embraces Tao.\n\nHe who aligns with Tao becomes one with Tao.\nHe who aligns with virtue attains supreme virtue.\nHe who fails to align with Tao is lost.\n\nHe who aligns with Tao is received by Tao.\nHe who aligns with virtue finds only virtue.\nHe who has become lost is close to home.\n\nFaith comes to the faithful.\n\nup\n\n24\n\nHe who stands on tiptoe is

brags of his success will not last long.\n\nObservers of Tao see these as spoiled food and pointless action—\nshunned even by the myriad creatures.\nOne who knows Tao does not abide them.\n\nup\n\n25\n\nFormless no-thing.\nPrecedent of heaven and earth.\nTimeless, unchanging, solitary, silent.\nIt is the mother of the ten thousand things.\n\nI do not know its name.\nI call it Tao.\nIf forced to describe it,\nI call it great.\n\nGreat implies vast reaches.\nVast reaches implies far away.\nFar away implies return.\n\nTao is great.\nHeaven is great.\nEarth is great.\nMan, too, is great.\nIn the realm there are four greats,\nand a noble man is one.\n\nMan follows the way of earth.\nEarth follows the way of heaven.\nHeaven follows the way of Tao.\nTao is the great Way.\n\nup\n\n26\n\nGravity is the ground of lightness.\nStillness is the master of unrest.\n\nThe sage can travel all day,\nyet never wander far from the baggage wagon.\nThough splendor and spectacle may beckon,\nhe remains unmoved, indifferent.\n\nWhy should the lord of ten thousand chariots act lightly?\nOne who acts lightly is not grounded.\nOne who is restless is not his own master.\n\n \n\nup\n\n27\n\nA good walker leaves no tracks.\nA good speaker does not slip up.\nA good accountant needs no counter.\n\nA good doorsmith uses no bolts or locks\nyet none can open what he closes.\nA good binder uses no knots\nyet what he binds cannot be unraveled.\n\nThe sage is good at saving souls and rejects no one.\nHe takes care of all things and abandons nothing.\nThis is called "the way of awareness."\n\nThe good man is the ignorant man's teacher.\nThe ignorant man is the good man's lesson.\nTo not honor the teacher and value the lesson—\nno matter how much wisdom one acquires—\nis to miss the mark.\nThis is an essential secret.\n\nup\n\n28\n\nKnow the strength of the male, but keep to the role of the female.\nBe the river of the world.\nBeing the river of the world, supreme virtue flows without end.\nFlowing without end, you are the timeless infant.\n\nKnow the purity of light but maintain darkness.\nBe the model of the world.\nBeing the model of the world, supreme virtue is constant.\nMaintaining constant virtue, you are the boundless realm.\n\nBe worthy of high honors, but keep to the role of the lowly.\nBe the valley of the world.\nBeing the valley of the world, supreme virtue is fulfilled.\nBeing fulfilled, you are the uncarved block.\n\nThe uncarved block appears as separate things.\nThe sage sees things as they are and rules the world.\nGreat power does not divide.\n\nup\n\n29\n\nThere are those who want to control the realm\nand make it more to their liking.\nThey will never succeed.\nThe realm of heaven and earth is perfect, a sacred vessel.\nIt cannot be improved.\nHe who tries to change it, destroys it for himself.\nHe who tries to hold it, loses all contact.\n\nIt is natural for beings to sometimes lead, sometimes follow,\nsometimes breathe hot, sometimes blow cold.\nsometimes expand, sometimes decay,\nsometimes overcome, sometimes collapse.\n\nThe sage therefore abandons pleasure, judgment and pride.\n\nup\n\n30\n\nWhen counseling rulers, observers of Tao do not advise force.\nThis is certain to bring consequences.\nWhere great armies have passed, thorn bushes thrive.\nFamine follows in the wake of war.\nA good ruler does only what is necessary to achieve results.\nHe does not abuse position.\n\nAchieve results, but do not glory in them.\nAchieve results, but do not boast.\nAchieve results, but be not proud.\nAchieve results because there is no choice.\nAchieve results but do not overpower.\n\nDoing more than necessary brings exhaustion.\nThis is not in harmony with Tao.\nWhat is not in harmony with Tao soon perishes.\n\nup\n\n31\n\nEven the finest weapons are instruments of ill omen,\nhated and feared by all creatures.\nObservers of Tao have no use for them.\n\nAt home, a man of virtue gives precedence to the left.\nAt war, he gives precedence to the right.\n\nWeapons are not the tools of a man of virtue.\nWeapons are instruments of ill omen,\nto be employed as a last resort.\nDo not relish their use\nor admire their excellence.\nTo see weapons as excellent is to relish killing.\nIf you relish killing you will never find the way.\n\nOn joyful occasions, precedence is given to the left.\nOn sad occasions, precedence is given to the right.\n\nWhen an army is arrayed, the lieutenant is placed on the left.\nThe commander is placed on the right.\nThus, war is conducted as a funeral rite.\nWhen multitudes are being killed,\nhold in your heart only sorrow.\nWhen victory is achieved,\nmark it with mourning.\n\nup\n\n32\n\nTao is the uncarved block.\nTimeless, undefined, infinitesimally subtle.\nNone is its master.\n\nIf lords and princes observed it,\nthe ten thousand things would arrive as guests to the table.\nHeaven and earth would rejoice\nand sweet nectar would fall,\nthough none under heaven had decreed it.\n\nWhen the whole is divided the parts are named.\nThere are already too many names.\nIt is time to stop.\nKnowing when to stop avoids exhaustion.\n\nTao in the world is like\nstream flowing to river flowing to sea.\n\nup\n\n33\n\nOne who knows others is wise.\nOne who knows self is enlightened.\nOne who masters others is strong.\nOne who masters self is powerful.\n\nKnowing you have enough is fulfillment.\nExerting strong effort brings exhaustion.\n\nHe who abides where he is lasts long.\nHe who dies without ceasing is timelessly present.\n\nup\n\n34\n\nGreat Tao flows everywhere,\nleft and right, all directions.\n\nThe ten thousand things depend on it\nand it does not turn away.\nIts purpose is fulfilled but it lays no claim.\n\nIt clothes and nourishes the ten thousand things\nbut is not their lord.\nIt desires nothing.\nIt is smaller than small.\n\nThe ten thousand things return to it\nbut it is not their master.\nIt is indeed great.\nBecause it knows nothing of greatness,\nit is greater than great.\n\nup\n\n35\n\nExtol the great illusion\nand the men of the world will gather.\nTalk of success, security and happiness\nand the multitudes will flock.\nOffer music and tasty food and travelers will stop in.\n\nTalk of Tao has no flavor.\nLook for it--there is nothing to see.\nListen for it--there is nothing to hear.\n\nMerge with it--there is no boundary or end.\n\nup\n\n36\n\nIf you want it to contract, let it expand.\nIf you want it to weaken, let it gain strength.\nTo bring a thing down, let it be raised high.\nTo bring a thing to you, let go.\n\nThis is called "perceiving the subtle workings."\n\nSoft and weak overcome hard and strong.\nA fish should not leave deep water.\nA country should not show off its power.\n\nup\n\n37\n\nTao does nothing yet nothing remains undone.\n\nWhen a noble man observes this\nthe ten thousand things are transformed.\nWhen the desire to act re-emerges,\nit is stilled by the nameless no-thing.\n\nWithout things there is no desire.\nWithout desire there is stillness.\nIn stillness, the realm of heaven and earth is perfect.\n\nup\n\n38\n\nThe man of high virtue is not aware of himself\nand thus attains supreme virtue.\nThe man of low virtue self-consciously strives\nand thus is without virtue.\n\nThe wise man does nothing\nyet leaves nothing undone.\nThe ignorant man is consumed by doing\nyet little is accomplished.\n\nThe compassionate man acts without motive.\nThe righteous man acts to gain merit.\nThe moral man acts to impose order.\nIf no one responds,\nhe bares his arms and becomes an enforcer.\n\nWhen Tao is lost there is virtue.\nWhen virtue is lost there is goodness.\nWhen goodness is lost there is morality.\nWhen morality is lost, rules of conduct are imposed.\n\nRules are the remnants of trust and faith,\nand the beginning of chaos.\nKnowledge is an ornamental blossom of Tao\nand the beginning of misunderstanding.\n\nThe sage dwells in the depths, not the surface,\nin the root not the flower.\nHe abides in one and lets go of the other.\n\nup\n\n39\n\nBefore time, these ancestors arise from One:\n\nHeaven arises from One and becomes clear.\nEarth arises from One and becomes firm.\nSpirit arises from One and becomes divine.\nEmptiness arises from One and becomes creation.\n\nThe ten thousand things arise from One\nand become manifest.\nKings and princes arise from One\nand become exalted.\nOne is the source of All.\n\nSeparated from the Source:\nthe clearness of heaven would vanish,\nthe firmament of earth would dissolve,\nthe divinity of spirit would dissipate,\ncreation would become desolation.\nThe ten thousand things would perish,\nand kingdoms would disappear.\n\nHumility is the root of honor.\nLowliness is the foundation of esteem.\n\nThus, a noble man considers himself\norphaned, bereft, unworthy.\nThis is knowing the humble source—is it not?\n\nTo seek praise is not praiseworthy.\nDo not jangle like jewelry.\nBe still as stone.\n\nup\n\n40\n\nTao moves by returning and acts by yielding.\nThus, the ten thousand things arise into being.\n\nBeing arises from non-being.\nThings arise from no-thing.\n\n \n\nup\n\n41\n\nWhen the wise student hears of Tao\nhe practices diligently.\nWhen the average student hears of Tao\nhe practices off and on.\nWhen the foolish student hears of Tao\nhe laughs out loud.\nIf the foolish do not laugh, it is not Tao.\n\nThus it is said:\nThe path of light is through darkness.\nThe road ahead leads back.\nThe easy way is most difficult.\nThe highest fulfillment is emptiness.\n\nTrue purity seems sullied.\nTrue abundance seems bereft.\nTrue power seems weak.\nTrue substance seems hollow.\n\nThe greatest region has no boundaries.\nThe best tools are fashioned slowly.\nThe highest sounds are hard to hear.\nThe perfect form has no shape.\n\nTao is unseen, undefined.\nYet Tao alone nourishes\nand brings all things to fulfillment.\n\nup\n\n42\n\nFrom Tao, One arises.\nFrom One, two.\nFrom two, three.\nThree becomes the ten thousand things.\n\nThe ten thousand things carry yin on their backs\nand hold yang in their arms.\nExistence depends on the two.\n\nMen hate to be orphaned, bereft, unworthy,\nyet this is how the noble man describes himself.\nLoss is gain, gain is loss.\n\nI teach what has always been taught:\n"A fervent man is surprised by death."\nI see this as the foundation of my teaching.\n\nup\n\n43\n\nUnder heaven, the soft and yielding\novercomes the hard and strong.\nThat without substance permeates the impenetrable.\n\nThus, I embrace non-action.\nTeach without words.\nWork without doing.\n\nFew under heaven understand this.\n\n \n\nup\n\n44\n\nName or person, which is more dear?\nPerson or possessions, which is more precious?\nGain or loss, which is more harmful?\n\nExcessive desire incurs great expense.\nOne who hoards treasure suffers loss.\nOne who knows enough is enough\nwill always have enough.\nOne who knows when to stop avoids exhaustion.\nThus, he will endure.\n\nup\n\n45\n\nPerfection appears imperfect\nbut has no flaw.\nFulfillment appears as emptiness\nbut has no limit.\n\nGreat truth is a paradox.\nGreat wisdom is self-evident.\nGreat eloquence is unpracticed.\n\nMovement overcomes cold.\nStillness overcomes heat.\nStillness and simplicity put all things right under heaven.\n\nup\n\n46\n\nWhen Tao is embraced in the realm,\nrace horses haul their own manure.\nWhen Tao is unknown in the realm,\nwar horses are bred at the borders.\n\nThere is no greater curse than desire,\nno greater misfortune than greed.\nHe who knows enough is enough\nwill always have enough.\n\nup\n\n47\n\nWithout leaving home one can know the whole world.\nWithout looking outside one can see heaven.\nLooking afar does not find what is near.\n\nThus, the sage knows without learning,\nsees without seeking,\nacts without doing.\n\nup\n\n48\n\nFor students of knowledge,\nevery day something is acquired.\nFor observers of Tao,\nevery day something falls away.\n\nLess and less is done\nuntil not-doing is achieved.\nWhen there is no doer,\nnothing remains to be done.\n\nThe realm of heaven and earth\nis ruled by timeless principles.\nHe who tries to interfere is not ready to receive it.\n\nup\n\n49\n\nThe sage has no heart or mind of his own.\nThus, he knows the heart and mind of all.\n\nI am good to the good\nand good to the not-so-good.\nThis is the goodness of Virtue.\n\nI trust the trustworthy\nand have faith in those who should not be trusted.\nThis is the faith of Virtue.\n\nThe sage is in harmony\nwith the realm of heaven and earth.\nHis mind is merged with the world.\nPeople turn to him and listen.\nHe treats them as his children.\n\nup\n\n50\n\nIn the passage from womb to grave\none in three are disciples of living.\nOne in three are disciples of death.\nOne in three are just passing through.\n\nAll believe they have life.\n\nHe who knows the truth of existence\ndoes not fear wild bulls or tigers.\nHe wears no armor in battle.\n\nBulls have no place to thrust their horns.\nTigers have no place to sink their claws.\nWeapons have no place to enter.\n\nWhy is this?\nBecause death is for the living.\n\nup\n\n51\n\nTao gives them life.\nVirtue gives them nourishment.\nThe manifest world gives them form.\nThe tendencies of each make them what they are.\n\nTherefore the ten thousand things honor Tao and esteem Virtue.\nThis honor and esteem are not commanded.\nIt is just the nature of things.\n\nAnd so, all things arise from Tao.\nBy Virtue they are nourished, developed, clothed,\nsheltered, soothed, aged and buried.\n\nTo create without possessing,\nto act without making claims,\nto lead without taking command—\nthis is timeless Virtue.\n\nup\n\n52\n\nWhere the realm of heaven and earth begins\ncould be called the mother of creation.\n\nKnowing the mother, become the child.\nBeing the child, stay close to the mother.\nDeath will not bother you.\n\nStay quiet, keep inside,\nand you will never want for anything.\nOpen your mouth, meddle in affairs,\nand you are beyond rescue.\n\nPerceiving the subtle is insight.\nTo yield requires strength.\nUse the light of creation to become illuminated\nand thus be saved.\n\nThis is called "entering the Absolute."\n\nup\n\n53\n\nIf I have the least bit of knowledge\nI will follow the great Way alone\nand fear nothing but being sidetracked.\nThe great Way is simple\nbut people delight in complexity.\n\nThe government is corrupt.\nThe fields are overgrown.\nThe granaries are empty.\nYet some wear fine clothes,\ncarry sharp swords,\ngorge on food and drink,\nand are surrounded by luxury.\nThey are thieves.\n\nThis is certainly not the great Way.\n\nup\n\n54\n\nWhat is deeply rooted will not topple.\nWhat is firmly grasped will not slip away.\n\nIt will be honored through generations of ancestors.\n\nCultivated in the self, Virtue is manifest.\nCultivated in the family, Virtue grows.\nCultivated in the village, Virtue flourishes.\nCultivated in the nation, Virtue abounds.\nCultivated in the universe, Virtue is everything.\n\nAs the self, observe the self.\nAs the family, observe the family.\nAs the village, observe the village.\nAs the nation, observe the nation.\nAs the universe, observe the universe.\n\nHow do I know the universe?\nLike this.\n\n \n\nup\n\n55\n\nA man of Virtue can be compared to a newborn child.\n\nSnakes and scorpions do not strike him.\nFierce beasts do not prey upon him.\nBirds of prey do not attack him.\n\nThough his bones are soft and his muscles weak,\nhis grip is firm.\nWithout knowing the union of man and woman,\nhis organ stands erect.\n\nHis vital force is strong.\nHe can scream all day without becoming hoarse.\nHis harmony is perfect.\n\nTo know harmony is to know the everlasting.\nTo know the everlasting is enlightenment.\n\nTo interfere with life is ill-fated.\nTo control the breath causes strain.\nIf you exert yourself you will become exhausted.\nThis is not in harmony with Tao.\n\nWhat is not in harmony with Tao does not long endure.\n\nup\n\n56\n\nOne who knows does not talk about it.\nOne who talks about it does not know.\n\nStay quiet.\nKeep inside.\nBlunt sharpness.\nUnravel entanglements.\nDiffuse brightness.\nMerge with dust.\n\nThis is called "discovering original nature."\n\nOne who knows original nature is\nindifferent to intimacy and estrangement,\nunconcerned with benefit and harm,\nimmune to honor and disgrace.\n\nHe is embraced by heaven.\n\nup\n\n57\n\nRule the country with sincerity.\nWage war with cunning.\nMaster the universe with indifference.\n\nHow do I know this is the way it is?\n\nBecause of this:\nThe more taboos, the poorer the people's spirit.\nThe sharper men's weapons, the more trouble in the land.\nThe greater the ingenuity, the more clutter in the world.\nThe more abundant the laws, the more abundant the thieves.\n\nTherefore the sage says:\nI take no action and the people naturally reform.\nI remain at peace and the people become content.\nI do not meddle and the people become prosperous.\nI desire nothing and the people return to original nature.\n\nup\n\n58\n\nWhen government does not interfere, the people are genuine.\nWhen government intrudes, the people are cunning.\n\nHappiness is founded on misery.\nMisery lurks within happiness.\nIs there an end to it?\nNothing stays the same.\nHonesty moves with deceit.\nGood flows with evil.\nBut people's delusion persists.\n\nThus, the sage is sharp but not divisive,\nstraightforward but not hurtful,\nprincipled but not severe,\nillumined but not blinding.\n\nup\n\n59\n\nIn leading people and serving heaven,\nnothing surpasses humility.\nHumility is having no preferences.\nHumility accumulates virtue.\n\nWhere virtue accumulates, nothing is impossible.\nWhen nothing is impossible, there are no limits.\nA man without limits is fit to rule the realm.\nThe mother of the realm is everlasting.\n\nThis is called being deeply rooted.\nTimeless awareness of Tao.\n\nup\n\n60\n\nGoverning a country is like cooking a delicate fish.\n\nRule in observance of Tao\nand the forces of adversity become harmless.\nThey do not lose their power,\nonly their power to harm.\n\nThe sage, too, does no harm\nand so he is not harmed.\nVirtue flows unimpeded.\n\n \n\nup\n\n61\n\nA country becomes great by lying low,\nlike the delta of a great river.\nThe confluence of the realm.\nThe mother of the world.\n\nThe female conquers the male by stillness.\nBeing still, she takes the lower position.\n\nA great country conquers a small country\nby taking the lower position.\nA small country conquers a great country\nby merging with it.\n\nThus, the great country conquers by yielding,\nthe small country conquers by being absorbed.\n\nThe great country needs more people.\nThe small country needs greater purpose.\nEach gets what it needs.\n\nIt is proper for greatness to yield.\n\nup\n\n62\n\nTao is the ground of the ten thousand things.\nIt is the refuge of the good man\nand the guardian of the bad.\n\nFine speech can buy high rank.\nGood deeds can earn respect.\nShould one without them be abandoned?\n\nTherefore, on the day the son is crowned\nand the three ministers named,\ndo not send gifts of jade and teams of horses.\nRemain still and offer Tao.\n\nWhy has Tao been honored since ancient times?\n"Seek and you will find; transgress and you will be forgiven."\nIs this not the reason?\n\nAbove all else, observe Tao.\n\nup\n\n63\n\nPerform not-doing.\nWork without motive.\nSavor what has no flavor.\n\nRegard the small as great, the few as many.\nRepay injury with compassion.\n\nSee simplicity in the complex.\nSee greatness in small gestures.\nConfront the difficult while easy.\nDo great things in small increments.\n\nThe sage does nothing great,\nbut great things are accomplished.\n\nEasy promises are easily broken.\nThings taken lightly become difficult.\nThe sage regards nothing lightly,\ntherefore nothing is difficult.\n\nup\n\n64\n\nThat which is still is easy to contain.\nWhat has not yet begun is easy to prevent.\nThe fragile is easily broken.\nThe minute is easily dispelled.\n\nSee things before they emerge.\nAttend to them before they grow out of control.\n\nA tree trunk that fills a man's arms\nbegins as a tiny shoot.\nA terrace nine stories high\nbegins with a basket of dirt.\nA journey of a thousand miles\nbegins underfoot.\n\nThose who strive meet defeat.\nThose who grasp lose their grip.\nThe sage does nothing and never fails.\nHe has nothing and never loses.\n\nFailure often comes on the verge of success.\nBe as careful in the end as the beginning\nand there will be no failure.\n\nThe sage desires no-desire.\nHe does not value wealth.\nHe learns by not thinking.\nHe restores to others what has been lost.\nHe helps the ten thousand things return to original nature\nbut does not interfere.\n\nup\n\n65\n\nThe ancient observers of Tao did not teach it to others.\nThey let them remain simple and unknowing.\nPeople are difficult to deal with when they think they know.\n\nLeaders who think they know are a curse to those they lead.\nLeaders with a simple heart are a blessing to all.\n\nBoth are manifestations of the same truth.\nKnowing the truth is Virtue.\nVirtue is mysterious, profound, far reaching.\nReaching far, it returns to itself and is complete.\n\nup\n\n66\n\nRivers rule valleys and seas rule rivers\nbecause they take the lower position.\n\nThe sage is elevated by placing himself below others.\nHe leads by leaving himself behind.\nWhen he assumes high position, the people do not feel his weight.\nWhen he rules they do not feel threatened.\nThe realm rejoices and never tires of his presence.\nBecause he does not contend, nothing stands against him.\n\nup\n\n67\n\nEveryone agrees the Tao I teach is great, yet unlike anything else.\nIndeed, if it were not singular it would not endure.\n\nI hold three treasures close:\nThe first is unconditional regard for all.\nThe second is being content with little.\nThe third is not placing myself before others.\n\nFrom compassion comes courage.\nFrom contentment comes an open heart.\nFrom humility comes the capacity to lead.\n\nDaring without mercy,\ngiving without generosity,\nruling without modesty,\nthis is the way of death.\n\nAttacking with compassion, you are victorious.\nDefending with compassion, you are impregnable.\nWhat heaven favors it infuses with compassion.\n\nup\n\n68\n\nA good general is not aggressive.\nA good warrior is not wrathful.\n\nA skillful conqueror does not instigate battle.\nA skillful employer serves those under him.\n\nThis is the virtue of not contending.\nThis is mastering the strength of others.\nThis is being in accord with the principles of heaven.\n\nup\n\n69\n\nSkillful warriors have a saying:\n"Do not move first, play the guest.\nDo not move forward an inch, retreat a foot."\n\nThis is called advancing without moving.\nReaching without showing one's arms.\nCapturing without attacking.\nDoing battle without weapons.\n\nThere is no greater mistake than underestimating the enemy.\nUnderestimating the enemy, I risk losing everything of value.\n\nThus, when equal opponents are matched,\nthe one aware of sorrow will prevail.\n\nup\n\n70\n\nWhat I teach is easy to understand and practice,\nyet no one understands it or puts it to practice.\n\nMy words are from the source.\nMy actions are those of the ancestor.\nPeople do not understand this.\nTherefore, they do not understand me.\n\nThose who see me as I am are rare.\nThose who seek to follow my teachings are few.\n\nThe sage wears coarse clothing\nbut carries jade in his pockets.\n\nup\n\n71\n\nTo know that you do not know is clarity.\nTo think that you know is sickness.\n\nBeing sick of sickness, one attains clarity.\nThe sage is sick of sickness.\nTherefore, he is clear.\n\nup\n\n72\n\nWhen people do not respect power,\ndisaster is on the horizon.\n\nDo not limit their space.\nDo not disrupt their lives.\nDo not oppress them\nand they will not tire of you.\n\nThe sage knows himself, but does not claim knowledge.\nHe loves himself, but does not feel important.\nHe lets go of that and chooses this.\n\n \n\nup\n\n73\n\nA courageous and reckless man will kill or be killed.\nA courageous and careful man preserves life.\nOf the two, which is beneficial and which brings harm?\nWho knows what heaven favors.\nEven the sage is unsure.\n\nThe way of heaven does not contend, yet overcomes.\nDoes not speak, yet converses.\nWithout being summoned it comes of its own,\nunhurried, and according to plan.\n\nThe net of heaven is vast.\nThough the mesh is wide, nothing slips through.\n\nup\n\n74\n\nIf people are not afraid of death,\nwhy threaten them with death?\n\nIf people are in constant fear of death,\nand if being unruly means you will be killed,\nwho would dare be unruly?\nWho would dare kill him?\n\nThere is always a lord of death.\nTrying to do his job is like\ntaking the place of an artisan.\nHe who tries to carve like a master carpenter\nrarely avoids being cut.\n\nup\n\n75\n\nWhy are the people starving?\nThe government takes their grain for taxes.\nTherefore they are starving.\n\nWhy are the people rebellious?\nThe government interferes in their lives.\nTherefore they are rebellious.\n\nWhy do people ignore the gravity of death?\nThey are consumed by the intensity of life.\nTherefore they ignore the gravity of death.\n\nOne who is not consumed by life\nis better off than one who values it.\n\nup\n\n76\n\nA man is born supple and soft.\nAt death he is rigid and hard.\nThe ten thousand things, the grass, the trees,\nwhile living are tender and pliant.\nIn death they are dry and withered.\n\nThe hard and unbending are companions of death.\nThe soft and yielding are companions of life.\n\nThus, an inflexible army is easily defeated.\nAn unbending tree is easily broken.\n\nThe hard and strong are laid low.\nThe soft and yielding are raised up.\n\nup\n\n77\n\nThe way of heaven, is it not like the stringing of a bow?\nThe high end is lowered, the low is raised up.\nIf the string is too long it is shortened.\nIf the string is too short it is lengthened.\n\nThe way of heaven takes from the excessive\nand gives to the insufficient.\nThe way of man is different.\nThose with too much take from those who have little.\n\nWho keeps just enough and gives the rest to the world?\nOnly observers of Tao.\n\nThe sage works without expectation.\nAchieves without taking credit.\nHe does not desire to seem worthy.\n\nup\n\n78\n\nIn all the world nothing is softer and weaker than water.\nYet for overcoming the hard and strong it is unequaled.\n\nThe pliant overcomes the unbending.\nThe submissive overcomes the unyielding.\nEveryone knows this but no one puts it into practice.\n\nTherefore the sage says:\nHe who takes on the suffering of the world is fit to rule it.\nOne who accepts the evils of the world as his own\nis a king under heaven.\n\nTruth is often a paradox.\n\nup\n\n79\n\nWhen bitter quarrels are settled,\nenmity is sure to remain.\nWhat can be done?\n\nA man of virtue pays his debts\nbut does not exact his due.\nHe fulfills his obligations\nbut makes no demands.\n\nThe Tao of heaven plays no favorites.\nIt flows with Virtue.\n\nup\n\n80\n\nLet the state be small.\nLet the people be few.\nThough they have equipment to arm ten battalions\nthey do not do it.\nThey take death seriously and do not venture far.\n\nThey have ships and carts\nbut there is no place they want to go.\nThey have armor and weapons\nbut they are not displayed.\n\nMen return to knotting rope.\nThey enjoy their meals and are comfortable in their clothes.\nThey are content in their homes and happy with their lives.\n\nThough the neighboring state is so close\nyou can hear the cocks and dogs,\nthey leave each other in peace as they grow old and die.\n\nup\n\n81\n\nTruth is not eloquent.\nEloquence is not truth.\nWise men do not try to persuade.\nWhoever tries to persuade is not wise.\n\nOne who knows, claims unknowing.\nOne who claims knowledge, does not know.\n\nThe sage does not acquire.\nHe bestows what he has on others\nand always has more.\nThe more he gives, the greater his abundance.\n\nThe way of heaven is to give without harm.\nThe way of the sage is to serve without striving.\n\n
