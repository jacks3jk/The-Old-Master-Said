5	1\n\nThe Tao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Tao;\nThe Name that can be named is not the eternal Name.\nThe Nameless [non-being] is the origin of heaven and earth;\nThe Namable [being] is the mother of all things.\nTherefore constantly without desire,\nThere is the recognition of subtlety;\nBut constantly with desire,\nOnly the realization of potentiality.\nThe two come from the same source,\nHaving different names.\nBoth are called mysteries,\nMore mystical than the most mystical,\nThe gate of all subtleties.\n\n\n\n2\n\nWhen all in the world recognize beauty as beauty, it is ugliness.\nWhen they recognize good as good, it is not good.\nTherefore,\nbeing and non-being beget each other,\nhard and easy complement each other,\nlong and short shape each other,\nhigh and low rely on each other,\nsound and voice harmonize with each other,\nfront and back follow each other.\nTherefore, the Sage administers without action and instructs without words.\nHe lets all things rise without dominating them,\nproduces without attempting to possess,\nacts without asserting,\nachieves without taking credit.\nAnd because he does not take credit, it will never leave him.\n\n\n\n3\n\nExalt not the worthy, so that the people will not fight.\nPrize not the rare treasure, so that they will not steal.\nExhibit not the desirable, so that their hearts will not be distracted.\nTherefore in governing, the Sage\nempties the people's hearts and fills their stomachs,\nweakens their will and strengthens their bones.\nHe always keeps them void of knowledge and desire, so that those who know will not dare to act.\nActing through inaction, he leaves nothing ungoverned.\n\n\n\n4\n\nTao is empty, used yet never filled.\nIt is deep, like the forefather of all things.\nIt dulls sharpness, and sorts tangles,\nBlends with the light, becoming one with the dust.\nSo serene, as if it hardly existed.\nI do not know whose son it is.\nIt seems to have preceded God.\n\n\n\n5\n\nWithout kindness heaven and earth treat all things as straw dogs.\nWithout kindness the Sage treats the people as straw dogs.\nThe space between heaven and earth is a vacuum like a bellows,\nEmptied, but inexhaustible.\nThe more it moves, the more it yields.\nToo much talk often brings exhaustion.\nIs it not better to keep to the middle path?\n\n\n\n6\n\nThe Valley Spirit never dies.\nIt is called the mystic female.\nThe door of the mystic female is the root of heaven and earth.\nBeing interminable and seeming to endure,\nIt can be used without toil.\n\n\n\n7\n\nHeaven lasts; earth endures.\nThey last and endure because they do not live for themselves.\nAnd thus can live forever.\nTherefore, the Sage positions himself behind and yet stays ahead.\nHe denies himself and so is preserved.\nIs it not because of his selflessness\nThat he completes his own?\n\n\n\n8\n\nThe man of sreme goodness resembles water.\nWater benefits all things\nWithout competing with them,\nStaying in places that men despise;\nTherefore, it is very close to Tao.\nDwelling in good places,\nHaving a heart that loves the profound,\nAllying with benevolence,\nInviting trust with words,\nBeing righteous in governing,\nManaging all things well,\nMoving at the right time.\nJust because he does not compete,\nThe man of sreme goodness frees himself of blame.\n\n\n\n9\n\nHold [a c] and fill it to the brim;\nIs it not better to stop in time?\nHammer and sharpen [an edge];\nIt cannot last long.\nFill a hall with gold and jade;\nThey cannot be protected.\nHe who is rich, honored, and arrogant brings blame on himself.\nHe who withdraws after achieving success and performing duty adheres to the Tao of heaven.\n\n\n\n10\n\nKeeping one's ying poh and embracing the One,\nCan man not depart from it?\nBreathing intensely to induce softness,\nCan man be like an infant?\nThe mystic vision being pure and clean,\nCan it be without flaw?\nLoving the people and governing the state,\nCan man be without action?\nOpening and closing the gate of heaven,\nCan it not be the female?\nDiscerning and understanding the four corners,\nCan man do so without knowledge?\nTo produce and to raise;\nTo produce without possessing;\nTo act without asserting;\nTo develop without controlling;\nThis is called the profound virtue.\n\n\n\n11\n\nThirty spokes converge in a nave;\njust because of its nothingness [void] the usefulness of the cart exists.\nMolded clay forms a vessel;\njust because of its nothingness [hollowness] the usefulness of the utensil exists.\nDoors and windows are cut into a house;\njust because of their nothingness [emptiness] the usefulness of the house exists.\nTherefore, profit from that which exists and utilize that which is absent.\n\n\n\n12\n\nThe five colors blind man's eyes.\nThe five notes deafen his ears.\nThe five tastes spoil his palate.\nThe chase and the hunt make his heart go mad.\nThe rare treasures constrain his actions.\nTherefore, the Sage provides for the belly and not for the eyes;\nHe rejects that to prefer this.\n\n\n\n13\n\nFavor and disgrace are likely to cause fear.\nHighly respect great trouble as one respects his own body.\nWhat is meant by "favor and disgrace are likely to cause fear"?\nFavor is for the inferior:\nObtaining it, one will fear it.\nLosing it, one will fear it.\nThis means that "favor and disgrace are likely to cause fear."\nWhat is meant by "highly respecting great trouble as one respects his own body"?\n"I have great trouble because I have a body;\nWhen I no longer have a body, how can I have trouble?"\nTherefore, one who respects himself for the world can be lodged with it;\nOne who loves himself for the world can be entrusted with it.\n\n\n\n14\n\nLooked at, it cannot be seen;\nit is called colorless.\nListened to, it cannot be heard;\nit is called soundless.\nGrasped, it cannot be obtained;\nit is called formless.\nThese three cannot be investigated further,\nso they merge together to make one.\nThe per part is not bright;\nThe lower part is not dark.\nSo subtle, it cannot be named,\nBut returns to nothingness.\nThis is called the shape without shape,\nthe image without image.\nThis is called indistinct:\nconfronting it, one cannot see the head;\nfollowing it, one cannot see the back.\nGrasp the Ancient Tao to manage present existence.\nThus we may know the beginning of the Ancient.\nThis is called the record of Tao.\n\n\n\n15\n\nThe Ancients who made themselves the best\nWere subtle and penetrating\nAnd deep beyond knowing.\nBecause they were beyond knowing,\nwe can only try to describe them:\nCautious, as if crossing the river in winter.\nCircumspect, as if afraid of the neighbors on four sides.\nDignified, as if a guest.\nExpansive, as melting ice.\nUnspoiled, as unhewn wood.\nBroad, as a valley.\nOpaque, as turbid puddles.\nWho can calm the turbid and clear it gradually?\nWho can stir the inert and bring it gradually to life?\nOne who keeps this Tao does not wish to be filled.\nAnd because he is not filled,\nhe can be sheltered and beyond renewal.\n\n\n\n16\n\nAttain the ultimate emptiness;\nMaintain the absolute tranquility.\nAll things rise together.\nAnd I observe their return ...\nThe multitude of all things return each to their origin.\nTo return to the origin means repose;\nIt means return to their destiny.\nTo return to their destiny means eternity;\nTo know eternity means enlightenment.\nNot knowing eternity is to do evil things blindly.\nTo know eternity means having capacity.\nCapacity leads to justice.\nJustice leads to kingship.\nKingship leads to Heaven.\nHeaven leads to Tao.\nTao is everlasting.\nThus the entire life will be without danger.\n\n\n\n17\n\nOf the best, the people barely know of his existence.\nOf the next best, the people love and praise him.\nOf the next one, the people are afraid of him.\nAnd of the next, the people despise him.\nHe who does not trust others enough will not be trusted by them.\nTherefore, hesitating, one should carefully choose his words.\nWhen he accomplishes his task and the things get done,\nThe people all say: "We have done it by ourselves."\n\n\n\n18\n\nWhen the Great Tao is abandoned,\nThere are human-heartedness and righteousness;\nWhen knowledge and wisdom arise,\nThere is great hypocrisy;\nWhen the six relations are not in accord,\nThere are filial piety and paternal affection;\nWhen a country is in disorder,\nThere are loyal ministers.\n\n\n\n19\n\nBanish sagacity; forsake wisdom.\nThe people will benefit a hundredfold.\nBanish human-heartedness; forsake righteousness.\nThe people will recover filial piety and paternal affection.\nBanish craftiness; forsake profit.\nThieves and robbers will no longer exist.\nThose three are serficial and inadequate.\nHence the people need something to abide by:\nDiscern plainness.\nEmbrace simplicity.\nReduce selfishness.\nRestrain desires.\n\n\n\n20\n\nAbandon learning; then one has no sorrow.\nBetween "yes" and "no", what is the difference?\nBetween good and evil, what is the difference?\nIf I should fear what the people fear,\nThen where is the end of my fear?\nLustily the people seem to be enjoying a feast\nOr ascending a tower in the springtime.\nI alone am unmoved, showing no sentiment,\nLike a baby who does not yet know how to smile.\nSo weary, I seem not to know where to return.\nWhile the multitudes have plenty,\nI alone seem to be left out.\nMy heart is like a fool's.\nHow chaotic!\nChaotic!\nWhile the common people are so bright,\nI alone am so dull!\nWhile the common people know how to differentiate,\nI alone cannot see the difference.\nBoundless as the sea,\nAimless as the breeze,\nI seem to have no stop.\nAll the people have their purpose,\nBut I alone am stubborn and despicable.\nI alone differ from the others\nAnd value getting nourishment from the Mother.\n\n\n\n21\n\nThe feature of great virtue is to follow only Tao.\nTao is something elusive and vague!\nThough vague and elusive, in it is the image.\nThough elusive and vague, in it is the substance.\nObscure and dim, in it is the spirit.\nThe spirit is truly genuine; in it is credibility.\nFrom ancient times until now,\nIts name has never disappeared.\nBy this the beginning of all things is known.\nHow can I know the beginning of all things?\nBy this.\n\n\n\n22\n\nTo yield is to have the whole.\nTo be crooked is to be straightened.\nTo be hollow is to be filled.\nTo be worn out is to be renewed.\nTo have a little is to get more.\nTo have a lot is to be confused.\nTherefore the Sage sets an example for the world\nBy embracing the One.\nBy not insisting on his view, he may become enlightened.\nBy not being self-righteous, he may become illustrious.\nBy not boasting, he may receive credit.\nBy not being arrogant, he may last long.\nAnd just because he does not compete, the entire world cannot compete with him.\nThe Ancients say: "to yield is to have the whole."\nAre these merely words?\nTruly the whole will return to him.\n\n\n\n23\n\nTo spare words is to be natural.\nTherefore a whirlwind does not last all morning,\nAnd a sudden shower does not last all day.\nWho causes this?\nHeaven and earth.\nIf even Heaven and earth cannot last long,\nWhat can man do?\nTherefore one dealing with Tao will resemble Tao.\nDealing with virtue, one will resemble virtue.\nDealing with loss, one will resemble loss.\nIf one resembles Tao, Tao is pleased to accept him.\nIf one resembles virtue, virtue is pleased to accept him.\nIf one resembles loss, loss is also pleased to accept him.\nBy not having enough credibility,\nOne will not be trusted [by others].\n\n\n\n24\n\nThose who rise on tiptoe cannot stand.\nThose who stride cannot walk.\nThose who hold to their views cannot be enlightened.\nThose who are self-righteous cannot shine.\nThose who boast cannot receive credit.\nThose who are arrogant cannot last long.\nIn the light of Tao, they are like left-over food and burdensome wens,\nEven despised by all creatures.\nSo those with Tao do not want to stay with them.\n\n\n\n25\n\nThere is a thing formed in chaos\nExisting before Heaven and Earth.\nSilent and solitary, it stands alone, unchanging.\nIt goes around without peril.\nIt may be the Mother of the world.\nNot knowing its name, I can only style it Tao.\nWith reluctance, I would call it Great.\nGreat means out-going.\nOut-going means far-reaching.\nFar-reaching means returning.\nTherefore, Tao is great.\nHeaven is great.\nEarth is great.\nThe king is great.\nIn the universe, there are four great things,\nand the king is one of them.\nMan abides by earth,\nEarth abides by heaven,\nHeaven abides by Tao,\nTao abides by nature.\n\n\n\n26\n\nHeaviness is the foundation of lightness.\nSerenity is the lord of rashness.\nTherefore the Sage who travels the whole day never leaves his heavily covered carts.\nThough there are spectacles of splendor, he stays composed and aloof.\nWhy as a ruler of ten thousand chariots would he treat himself lightly in the world?\nLightness will lose the foundation.\nRashness will lose the lord.\n\n\n\n27\n\nA good walker leaves no trail.\nA good speaker leaves no grounds for blame.\nA good counter needs no calculator.\nA well-closed door needs no bolt\nand still cannot be opened.\nA well-tied knot needs no binding\nand still cannot be untied.\nTherefore the Sage is always able to save his people\nand there is no one forsaken.\nHe is able to save all things\nand there is nothing wasted.\nThis is called inherited enlightenment.\nTherefore the good man is the teacher of the bad.\nAnd the bad man is the material for the good.\nHe who fails to value the teacher and cherish the material,\nIs utterly lost in spite of his knowledge.\nThis is called crucial subtlety.\n\n\n\n28\n\nKnowing the male and keeping the female,\nOne will become the river of the world.\nBeing the river of the world,\nOne will not digress from constant virtue,\nAnd will return to being a baby.\nKnowing the white and keeping the black,\nOne will become a model of the world.\nBeing a model of the world,\nOne will not deviate from constant virtue,\nAnd will return to the infinite.\nKnowing honor and keeping disgrace,\nOne will become the valley of the world.\nBeing the valley of the world,\nOne will be content with constant virtue,\nAnd return to the unhewn wood.\nUnhewn wood when scattered will become vessels.\nThe Sage makes use of them to become the chief officer.\nTherefore the great system will not be cut apart.\n\n\n\n29\n\nHe who wants to take the world and act on it will not be able to achieve, I know.\nThe world is a sacred vessel\nWhich cannot be acted on.\nTo act on it is to destroy it.\nTo seize it is to lose it.\nSo the things\nEither lead or follow;\nEither whistle or blow;\nEither are strong or weak;\nEither defeat or fall.\nThat is why the Sage abandons the excessive, the extravagant, and the extreme.\n\n\n\n30\n\nThose who aid the ruler with Tao do not use military force to conquer the world.\nBecause this will invite retaliation.\nWhere the army stays, briers and thorns grow.\nAfter a great war comes the year of adversity.\nThe good man stops after getting results.\nWithout daring to conquer.\nHe achieves results without bragging,\nAchieves results without exalting,\nAchieves results without arrogance,\nAchieves results with reluctance,\nAchieves results without conquering.\nA thing in its prime soon becomes old;\nThis is not Tao.\nNot being Tao, it is sure to die early.\n\n\n\n31\n\nFine weapons are the tools of evil;\nAll things are likely to hate them.\nSo those with Tao do not want to deal with them.\nThe gentleman who stays at home values the left;\nIn war, he values the right.\nWeapons are the tools of evil,\nnot the tools of the gentleman.\nWhen he uses them unavoidably, he is most calm and detached\nAnd does not glorify his victory.\nTo glorify means to relish the murder of people,\nRelishing the murder of people,\nOne cannot exercise his will in the world.\nHappy occasions prefer the left.\nSorrowful occasions prefer the right.\nThe lieutenant-general is placed on the left.\nThe general-in-chief is placed on the right.\nThis means observing this occasion with funeral rites.\nHaving killed many people, one should lament with sorrow and grief.\nVictory in war must be observed with funeral rites.\n\n\n\n32\n\nTao is constantly nameless.\nThough the unhewn wood is small,\nNo one in the world dares to subjugate it.\nIf dukes and kings can keep it,\nAll things will become guests by themselves.\nHeaven and earth conjugate in dropping sweet dew;\nPeople without being ordered are fair to each other.\nIn the beginning of creation, all were given names.\nHaving names, they know their limits.\nKnowing their limits keeps them from danger.\nThus Tao is to the world\nAs brooks and valleys are to rivers and seas.\n\n\n\n33\n\nTo know others is to be clever.\nTo know oneself is to have discernment.\nTo overcome others takes force.\nTo overcome oneself takes strength.\nTo be content is riches.\nTo act perseveringly takes will.\nNot to lose one's place means one can last long.\nTo die without extinction means longevity.\n\n\n\n34\n\nThe great Tao overflows,\nable to move left and right.\nAll things rely on it for life,\nBut it does not dominate them.\nCompleting its task without possession,\nClothing and feeding all things,\nWithout wanting to be their master.\nAlways void of desire,\nIt can be called Small.\nAll things return to it\nWithout its being their master;\nIt can be called Great.\nJust because the Sage would never regard himself as great,\nHe is able to attain his own greatness.\n\n\n\n35\n\nHold on to the great image\nAnd the whole world will follow.\nFollowing without harm, in safety, peace, and comfort.\nMusic and viand will cause the traveler to stop.\nBut Tao spoken by mouth is flavorless and bland.\nLooked at, it cannot be seen.\nListened to, it cannot be heard.\nUsed, it will never be exhausted.\n\n\n\n36\n\nAbout to shut it, let it first be opened.\nAbout to weaken it, let it first be strengthened.\nAbout to destroy it, let it first be advanced.\nAbout to snatch it, let it first be given away.\nThis is called the subtle wisdom.\nThe soft overcomes the hard;\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\nAs fish cannot be separated from deep water,\nThe state's sharp weapons cannot be shown to the people.\n\n\n\n37\n\nTao is always inactive.\nBut it leaves nothing undone.\nIf dukes and kings can keep it,\nThen all things will be naturally transformed.\nIf transformation raises desires,\nI would spress them with nameless simplicity.\nNameless simplicity means being without desires.\nBeing without desires and with tranquility,\nThe world will keep peace by itself.\n\n\n38\n\nHe with the highest virtue\nDoes not display his virtue\nAnd so has virtue.\nHe with the lowest virtue\nDoes not let go of virtue\nAnd so has no virtue.\nHe with the highest virtue does not act\nAnd nothing is left undone.\nHe with the lowest virtue acts\nAnd has intent to act.\nHe with the highest human-heartedness acts\nAnd has no intent to act.\nHe with the highest righteousness acts\nAnd has intent to act.\nHe with the highest propriety acts\nAnd if there is no response,\nBares his arms to apply force.\nTherefore,\nWhen Tao is lost, virtue appears.\nWhen virtue is lost, human-heartedness appears.\nWhen human-heartedness is lost, righteousness appears.\nWhen righteousness is lost, propriety appears.\nPropriety is the thinness of loyalty and honesty,\nAnd the beginning of disorder;\nForeknowledge is the ornament of Tao,\nAnd the beginning of ignorance.\nTherefore, great gentlemen stay in the thick, and not in the thin.\nThey stay with the substance, and not with the ornament.\nSo they reject that to prefer this.\n\n\n\n39\n\nThose of ancient times obtained the One:\nHeaven obtained the One for its clarity;\nEarth obtained the One for its tranquility;\nThe Spirit obtained the One for its divinity;\nThe Valley obtained the One for its repletion;\nAll things obtained the One for their lives;\nDukes and kings obtained the One for the rectitude of the world.\nWhat causes these is the One.\nWithout clarity, Heaven could not avoid disrting.\nWithout tranquility, Earth could not avoid explosion.\nWithout divinity, The Spirit could not avoid dissolving.\nWithout repletion, The Valley could not avoid dissipating.\nWithout life, All things could not avoid perishing.\nWithout rectitude and dignity, Dukes and kings could not avoid falling.\nTherefore, distinction has humility as its root;\nThe high regards the low as its foundation.\nTherefore dukes and kings call themselves\nOrphans, widowers, and starvers.\nDoes this not mean regarding humility as a base?\nDoesn't it?\nHe who is most praise-worthy\nDoes not need any praise.\nHe prefers to be neither rare as jade,\nNor as common as rocks.\n\n\n\n40\n\nReturning is Tao's motion.\nWeakness is Tao's function.\nAll things in the world are produced by being.\nAnd being is produced by non-being.\n\n\n\n41\n\nThe serior man, on hearing Tao,\nPractices it diligently.\nThe average man, on hearing Tao,\nRegards it both as existing and not existing.\nThe inferior man, on hearing Tao,\nLaughs aloud at it.\nWithout his laughter, it would not be Tao.\nTherefore the established word says:\nThe luminous Tao seems obscure.\nThe advancing Tao seems retreating.\nThe even Tao seems rough.\nThe highest virtue seems empty.\nGreat whiteness seems blackened.\nBroad virtue seems insufficient.\nEstablished virtue seems secret.\nPure substance seems fluid.\nThe great square has no corners.\nThe great vessel is late in completing.\nThe great voice sounds faint.\nThe great image has no shape.\nTao is concealed and has no name.\nYet only Tao is good in giving and completing.\n\n\n\n42\n\nTao begets One.\nOne begets Two.\nTwo begets Three.\nThree begets all things.\nAll things carry the female and embrace the male.\nAnd by breathing together, they live in harmony.\nWhat the people hate is being orphaned, widowed, and starved.\nBut kings and dukes call themselves these names.\nTherefore everything can be augmented when diminished, and diminished when augmented.\nWhat the people teach, I teach too.\nThe violent and fierce cannot die a natural death.\nI will become the father of teaching.\n\n\n\n43\n\nThe world's softest thing gallops to and fro through the world's hardest thing.\nThings without substance can penetrate things without crevices.\nThus I know the benefit of inaction.\nBut teaching without words and benefitting without action are understood by few in the entire world.\n\n\n\n44\n\nOf fame and life, which is more dear?\nOf life and wealth, which is more worthy?\nOf gain and loss, which is more distressing?\nTherefore, loving in excess incurs great cost.\nOverhoarding brings heavy loss.\nTo know what is enough means to avoid disgrace.\nTo know where to stop is to avoid danger.\nThus one can last long and endure.\n\n\n\n45\n\nGreat completion appears to be imperfect,\nYet its usefulness is never exhausted.\nGreat fullness appears to be empty,\nYet its usefulness is unlimited.\nGreat straightness seems bent.\nGreat craftiness seems clumsy.\nGreat eloquence seems to be stuttering.\nHastiness overcomes the cold.\nSerenity overcomes the hot.\nCalmness and serenity become the rectitude of the world.\n\n\n\n46\n\nIn a world with Tao,\nracing horses are drawn back [to the fields] for dung.\nIn a world without Tao,\nwar horses are raised outside the city.\nNo crime is greater than having desires.\nNo calamity is greater than not knowing contentment.\nNo fault is greater than longing for gain.\nTherefore, the contentment of knowing contentment is always contentment.\n\n\n\n47\n\nWithout going out-of-doors,\nOne can know the whole world.\nWithout looking out of windows,\nOne can see the Tao of heaven.\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\nTherefore, the Sage does not go and yet knows,\nDoesn't see and yet names,\nDoesn't act and yet completes.\n\n\n\n48\n\nThe pursuit of learning increases daily.\nThe pursuit of Tao decreases daily,\nDecreasing more and more\nUntil it reaches the point of inaction.\nInaction: then nothing cannot be done by it,\nTherefore the capture of the world should always be done by inactivity.\nAs for activity, it is insufficient to capture the world.\n\n\n\n49\n\nThe Sage has no constant heart [mind].\nHe takes the people's heart as his heart.\nGood men, I treat well.\nBad men, I also treat well.\nTherein I attain goodness.\nHonest men, I trust.\nDishonest men, I also trust.\nTherein I attain trust.\nThe Sage in his position in the world,\nYieldingly harmonizes the people's heart with simplicity.\nThe people all strain their ears and eyes.\nAnd the Sage regards them all as infants.\n\n\n\n50\n\nComing out means life; going in means death.\nThree-tenths of men are disciples of life.\nThree-tenths of men are disciples of death.\nThree-tenths of men actually have life, but strive for death through activity.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they over-nourish themselves.\nSo I have heard that he who is capable of sustaining life\nCan travel on land without ever encountering a rhinoceros or tiger;\nCan enter a battle without ever being touched by arms and weapons.\nThe rhinoceros cannot charge him with its horns.\nThe tiger cannot attack him with its claws.\nWeapons have no place to lodge their blades.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause he has no grounds for death.\n\n\n\n51\n\nTao begets them.\nVirtue nurtures them.\nMatter gives them form.\nCircumstances bring them into completion.\nTherefore all things not only respect Tao but also value virtue.\nYet Tao is respected and virtue is valued.\nWithout being ordered, they come naturally.\nTherefore Tao begets them.\nVirtue nurtures them, grows them and rears them, perfects them and ripens them, nourishes them and shelters them.\nBegetting without possessing;\nActing without asserting;\nDeveloping without controlling;\nThis is called mystical virtue.\n\n\n\n52\n\nThe world had a beginning\nWhich was the mother of the world.\nHaving known the mother, we know the son.\nHaving known the son, we keep the mother.\nThus, through life, we are without danger.\nBlock the passage;\nShut the door;\nThroughout life there will be no toil.\nOpen the passage;\nMultiply the activities;\nThroughout life there will be no cure.\nTo discern the small is called enlightenment;\nTo preserve weakness is called strength.\nUse the light;\nReturn to enlightenment;\nLeave nothing to harm the body;\nThis is called practicing the constant.\n\n\n\n53\n\nIf only I could have a little knowledge, I would walk in the Great Tao,\nBeing afraid only of acting on it.\nThe Great Tao is very smooth,\nBut people prefer the by-paths;\nThe court is very well kept;\nThe fields are full of weeds;\nAnd the granaries are extremely empty.\nTo wear embroidered clothes,\nTo carry sharp weapons,\nTo be satiated in food and drink,\nAnd to have excessive treasures and goods -\nThis is called robbery and extravagance.\nReally, this is not Tao.\n\n\n\n54\n\nTo be built well is not to be toppled.\nTo be held fast is not to slip.\nWith this, children and grandchildren will never stop offering sacrifice to their ancestors.\nWith this to cultivate oneself, one's virtue will be true;\nWith this to cultivate the family, its virtue will be plentiful;\nWith this to cultivate the community, its virtue will last long;\nWith this to cultivate the nation, its virtue will be abundant;\nWith this to cultivate the world, its virtue will be good.\nTherefore,\nExamine a person with a person,\nExamine a family with a family,\nExamine a community with a community,\nExamine a nation with a nation,\nExamine a world with a world.\nHow can I know this is the way of the world?\nBy this.\n\n\n\n55\n\nMaintaining an abundance of virtue is comparable to being an infant.\nPoisonous insects will not sting;\nFerocious beasts will not seize;\nPredatory birds will not pounce;\nThe bones are tender, the sinews are soft, but the grasp is firm.\nNot knowing the union of male and female,\nThe organ is fully formed;\nThis is the zenith of essence.\nHowling and screaming all day without getting hoarse;\nThis is the zenith of harmony.\nTo know harmony means to be constant;\nTo know constancy means enlightenment;\nTo benefit one's own life is ill-fated.\nTo let one's heart direct vigor is to become stark.\nThings in their prime will become old;\nThis is not Tao.\nBeing not Tao means to die early.\n\n\n\n56\n\nThe one who knows does not speak.\nThe one who speaks does not know.\nBlock the passage.\nClose the door.\nDull the sharpness.\nLoosen the tangles.\nBlend with light.\nBecome one with the dust.\nThis is called mystical identity.\nHence,\nOne can be neither close to it, nor far from it;\nOne can neither benefit it, nor harm it;\nOne can neither value it, nor despise it.\nTherefore, it is valued by the world.\n\n\n\n57\n\nRule the state with rectitude.\nDirect the army with trickery.\nCapture the world through inactivity.\nHow can I know it shall be so?\nBy this:\nWhen the world is full of taboos and prohibitions,\nThe people will become very poor.\nWhen the people possess many sharp weapons,\nThe nation will become more chaotic.\nWhen the people possess much craftiness,\nTrickery will flourish.\nWhen law and order become more conspicuous,\nThere will be more robbers and thieves.\nTherefore the Sage says:\nI do not act and the people reform themselves;\nI love serenity and the people rectify themselves;\nI employ inactivity and the people become prosperous themselves;\nI have no desires and the people become simple by themselves.\n\n\n\n58\n\nWhen the government is sluggish and dull,\nThe people are honest and content;\nWhen the government is discriminating and exacting,\nThe people are wily and restless.\nCalamity is what good fortune depends on.\nGood fortune is what calamity hides in.\nWho knows their utmost?\nIs it not better to have no rectitude?\nRectitude returns to trickery;\nAnd goodness returns to evil.\nThe people's delusion has long existed.\nTherefore, the Sage is square but not cutting;\nis honest but does not hurt;\nis straight but does not bully;\nis bright but does not shine.\n\n\n\n59\n\nIn governing the people and serving heaven,\nThere is nothing like thriftiness.\nOnly through thriftiness can one submit [to Tao] early;\nHaving submitted early, one accumulates virtue.\nHaving accumulated virtue, one can overcome everything.\nHaving overcome everything, one can know no limits.\nKnowing no limits, one is able to rule a nation.\nPossessing the mother of the nation, he may last long.\nThis is called the deep root and firm stalks,\nAnd the way to longevity and everlasting vision.\n\n\n\n60\n\nTo rule a large nation is as to cook a small fish.\nIn a world with Tao prevailing,\nGhosts will not become goblins.\nNot that ghosts will not become goblins,\nBut God will not hurt the people;\nNot that God will not hurt the people,\nBut the Sage will not hurt them either.\nWhen both will not hurt each other,\nAll virtue will converge to them.\n\n\n\n61\n\nA large state is like the low land;\nIt is the focus point of the world\nAnd the female of the world.\nThe female always conquers the male by serenity.\nIn serenity, she puts herself low.\nTherefore, the large state puts itself beneath the small state,\nAnd thereby absorbs the small state.\nThe small state puts itself under the large state,\nAnd thereby joins with the large state.\nTherefore, one either puts himself beneath to absorb others,\nOr puts himself under to join with others.\nWhat the large state wants is no more than to feed the people.\nWhat the small state wants is no more than to join and serve the people.\nBoth have their needs satisfied.\nThus the large ought to stay low.\n\n\n\n62\n\nTao is the refuge of all things:\nThe treasure of the good man and the shield of the bad man.\nBeautiful words can be for sale.\nGood deeds can become gifts to others.\nIf a man is bad, can he be forsaken?\nTherefore when the king is crowned and the three dukes are installed,\nThough large, priceless jade preceding a team of four horses can be offered,\nIt is not as good as sitting down and offering this Tao.\nWhy did the ancients treasure this Tao?\nWasn't it said:\n"With this Tao, the seeker will obtain, and the guilty will be spared"?\nTherefore it is valued by the world!\n\n\n\n63\n\nActing by inaction;\nDoing by not doing;\nTasting by not tasting.\nWhether it is great or small, whether it is much or little,\nAlways repaying malice with virtue.\nPlanning difficulties from the easier.\nEmploying the great from the small.\nThe world's difficult things surely begin with the easy.\nThe world's great things surely begin with the small.\nTherefore, the Sage never does anything to be great\nAnd so accomplishes greatness.\nTo take one's promises lightly results in little confidence.\nTo take things too easily results in much difficulty.\nTherefore, even the Sage takes things seriously.\nAnd never has any difficulty.\n\n\n\n64\n\nThings at rest are easy to hold.\nThings unbegun are easy to plan.\nFragile things are easy to shatter.\nTiny things are easy to scatter.\nManage things before they exist.\nSet things in order before they become chaotic.\nA tree as big as one's embrace originates from a rootlet.\nA nine-story terrace begins with a heap of earth.\nA thousand-li journey starts from beneath one's feet.\nTo act means to fail;\nTo insist means to lose.\nThe Sage does not act and therefore never fails;\nHe does not insist and therefore never loses.\nWhen the people undertake to do something,\nThey almost always fail at the point of success.\nOne should be cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nThen there will be no failure.\nTherefore the Sage desires no desires,\nValues not the rare treasures,\nLearns from the unlearned,\nReverses the faults of the people,\nAnd assists all things in their natural development,\nNever daring to interfere.\n\n\n\n65\n\nThe Ancients who were good in practicing Tao\nDid not teach the people with intelligence\nBut kept them in ignorance.\nThe people are hard to govern when they know too much.\nTherefore, one who rules the nation with knowledge robs the nation.\nOne who does not rule the nation with knowledge brings good fortune to the nation.\nTo know these two things means to know the standard.\nTo constantly know the standard is called mystical virtue.\nMystical virtue goes deep and far.\nIt returns with all things to reach great harmony.\n\n\n\n66\n\nRivers and seas become the kings of one hundred valleys\nBecause they are able in putting themselves below;\nSo they can become their kings.\nTherefore, for the sake of staying above the people,\nThe Sage must lower himself with words.\nFor the sake of staying ahead of the people,\nHe must put himself behind them.\nTherefore, the Sage stays above and the people do not feel the burden.\nHe stays in front and the people do not consider him harmful.\nTherefore the whole world delights in exalting him without tiring.\nBecause he does not compete,\nThe whole world cannot fight with him.\n\n\n\n67\n\nThe whole world says that\nMy Tao is great but seems to resemble nothing.\nBecause it is great, it seems to resemble nothing.\nIf resembling anything, it would have become small long ago.\nI have three treasures\nTo be kept and treasured;\nOne is compassion.\nThe second is thriftiness.\nThe third is not daring to be ahead of the world.\nThrough compassion, one can be brave.\nThrough thriftiness, one can be expansive.\nNot daring to be ahead of the world,\nOne can be the master of the vessels.\nNow to abandon compassion and to be brave,\nTo abandon thriftiness and to be expansive,\nTo abandon the rear and to be in front -\nThat means death!\nCompassion, in attack, will bring victory;\nIn defense, it will hold firmly.\nWhen heaven is going to save a person,\nIt will protect him with compassion.\n\n\n\n68\n\nOne who makes a good general is not warlike;\nOne who makes a good fighter is not angry;\nOne who makes a great conqueror of his enemies does not strive;\nOne who knows how to manage the people well places himself under them.\nThis is called the virtue of not competing.\nThis is called the power of using people.\nThis is called the match of Heaven, the ultimate of the Ancients.\n\n\n\n69\n\nThe commander of war has said:\n"I dare not be a host, but be a guest.\nI dare not advance one inch, but withdraw a foot."\nThis means:\nTo set  a march as if without one.\nTo stretch the arm as if without one.\nTo confront the enemy as if without one.\nTo grasp war weapons as if without them.\nNo calamity is greater than taking the enemy lightly.\nTaking the enemy lightly almost makes me lose my treasures.\nTherefore, in raising arms against each other,\nThe one with pity will win.\n\n\n\n70\n\nMy words are very easily understood, and very easily put into practice.\nYet no one in the world is able to understand and to practice them.\nMy words have their root; my deeds have their lord.\nJust because the people do not know, they do not know me.\nThose who know me are few.\nThose who emulate me are rare.\nTherefore, the Sage wears coarse clothes on the outside,\nAnd bears precious jade near his breast.\n\n\n\n71\n\nHe who knows that he does not know is the best.\nHe who does not know but pretends to know is sick.\nHe who realizes the sickness is sickness\nDoesn't have any sickness.\nThe Sage is without sickness\nBecause he realizes the sickness is sickness.\nTherefore, he doesn't have any sickness.\n\n\n\n72\n\nIf the people do not dread power,\nThere will be the appearance of great power.\nDo not restrict their living quarters.\nDo not disturb their livelihood.\nJust because one does not annoy them,\nHe will not be annoyed by them.\nTherefore, the Sage knows himself but does not display himself.\nHe loves himself but does not distinguish himself.\nTherefore, he rejects that to prefer this.\n\n\n\n73\n\nTo be brave in daring is to be killed.\nTo be brave in not daring is to live.\nBoth of them are either beneficial or harmful.\nWho knows the real reason for heaven's hatred?\nEven the Sage would find it difficult.\nThe Tao of heaven does not compete, but is good in winning;\ndoes not speak, but is good in responding;\ndoes not summon, but things come by themselves;\nbehaves calmly, but is good in planning.\nThe net of heaven is so vast.\nAlthough it is wide open, it loses nothing.\n\n\n\n74\n\nIf the people do not fear death,\nWhy threaten them with death?\nIf we let the people always fear death,\nAnd we capture and kill those who use trickery,\nWho would dare [to use trickery]?\nThose responsible for executions perform executions.\nBut those who perform executions for them\nAre doing no more than carving wood for the greater carpenter.\nAnd those who carve wood for the great carpenter\nCan rarely fail to injure their own hands.\n\n\n\n75\n\nThe people are starving\nBecause the man on top devours too much tax money.\nSo they are starving.\nThe people are hard to govern\nBecause the man on top is too active in governing.\nSo they are hard to govern.\nThe people think little of death\nBecause the man on top strives for a rich life.\nSo they think little of death.\nTherefore it is better to do nothing for one's life\nThan to value it.\n\n\n\n76\n\nIn life, man is sple and tender.\nIn death, he becomes rigid and stark.\nMyriad things such as grass and trees are sple and frail in life,\nAnd shrivelled and dry in death.\nTherefore, the rigid and stark are disciples of death,\nWhile the sple and weak are disciples of life.\nTherefore the army that uses strength cannot win.\nThe tree that stands firm will break.\nThe strong and large are subordinate;\nThe soft and weak are serior.\n\n\n\n77\n\nPerhaps the Tao of heaven resembles the drawing of a bow.\nWhen it is high, lower it.\nWhen low, raise it.\nWhen excessive, diminish it.\nWhen deficient, replenish it.\nThe Tao of heaven diminishes the excessive and replenishes the deficient.\nThe Tao of man is not so - while decreasing the deficient, it splies the excessive.\nWho can sply the world with overabundance?\nOnly the man with Tao.\nTherefore the Sage acts without exalting his ability.\nHe achieves without dwelling on it.\nHe does not want to display his seriority.\n\n\n\n78\n\nNothing in the world is softer and weaker than water.\nYet, in attacking the hard and strong, nothing can surpass it.\nBecause nothing can exchange places with it,\nUse weakness to overcome strength,\nUse softness to overcome hardness.\nNone in the world do not know this.\nBut none can practice it.\nTherefore the Sage says:\nTo suffer dishonor for the state\nis to be the lord of the community;\nTo bear the calamity of the state\nis to be the king of the world.\nTrue words seem paradoxical.\n\n\n\n79\n\nThe settlement of great grudge always leaves some residue grudge!\nHow can this be remedied?\nTherefore, the Sage retains the left stub of the contract,\nAnd does not make claims on others.\nThe man with virtue keeps the contract,\nWhile the man without virtue collects the tax.\nThe Tao of heaven plays no favoritism;\nIt is always for the good man.\n\n\n\n80\n\nThe state may be small; its people may be few.\nLet the people have tenfold and one-hundredfold of utensils,\nBut never make use of them.\nLet the people weigh death heavily\nAnd have no desires to move far away.\nThough there be boats and carriages,\nNo one will ride in them.\nThough there be armour and weapons,\nNo one will exhibit them.\nLet the people return to tying knots and using them.\nRelish their food,\nAppreciate their clothes,\nSecure in their homes,\nHappy with their customs.\nThe neighboring states will be so close that they can see each other, and hear the sounds of roosters and dogs.\nBut the people will grow old and die,\nWithout having visited each other.\n\n\n\n81\n\nSincere words are not kind;\nKind words are not sincere.\nOne who is good will never argue;\nOne who argues is not good.\nOne who knows does not know all;\nOne who knows all does not know at all.\nThe Sage does not store things for himself.\nThe more one does for others,\nThe more he has for himself.\nThe more one gives to others,\nThe more he keeps for himself.\nThe Tao of heaven is to benefit others without hurting them.\nThe Tao of the Sage is to act without competing.
