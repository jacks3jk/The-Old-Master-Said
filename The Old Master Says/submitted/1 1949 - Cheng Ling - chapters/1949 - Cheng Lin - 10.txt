1	10	When the spirit holds fast to the body, how can there be disunion! When the vital force attains the utmost degree of pliancy, how can one fail to resemble a new-born babe! When the mind is purified, how can there be blemishes! When the ruler truly loves the people, how can he fail to accomplish things! When the sensual organs are properly used, how can one fail to have strength! When the intellectual faculties are properly employed, how can one fail to have understanding! The mysterious Nature is that which produces, grows, lives without the desire for ownership, gives without the wish for return, rules without claiming lordship.
